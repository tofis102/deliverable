PHIND employee focus group 3

SM:

So this is really where you come in. We need your input to help us to firstly,
understand the challenges that come from working from home and then
secondly we’d like to identify where there are opportunities for you to break
up the time you spend sitting when you’re working at home.
So it’s now over to you. We’ve got some questions that we’d like to go
through with you today. We’ll spend about probably half an hour on these,
maybe 25 minutes and then we’ll move on to having a look at the strategies
that we have identified from the office. So I will pass over now to Claire and
Divya who will work through the questions with you.

CF:

Great, thanks very much, Sarah. So just following on from what Sarah’s
been saying, we’re going to work through three questions with you in the
next 25 minutes or so, and the first of these is just really about that
information that you got in the infographic that hopefully you’ve had a
chance to look at and just what do you think about that information and what
your initial thoughts or perceptions were when you saw that infographic?
So feel free to just raise your hand or you can click put your hand up or feel
free to chat into the chat, but just tell us what your initial thoughts were.
Yes, Ivy, go on ahead. I think you’re on mute, Ivy.

Ivy:

Sorry, no, I agree with the infographic that it does seem like working from
home does lead to more sitting. I’ve certainly felt that I have to be proactive
about the fact of trying to get out and about and also I notice that when I
commute to work I have to park further out from work and then walk in and
that’s a lot of the steps for my day, and the reasons for going into work as
well, at the moment I’m going into work once or twice a week, so I go in
when I need to file documents. So some of that walking is actually just to
the printer and back or to lunch, to see people.
So yes, I think that working from home has meant that I’m more sedentary.
I know at the beginning of lockdown I think that was a little bit different. I
was monitoring my step count and I think everyone was out walking a bit
more, so yes, I think that you need to be more proactive about getting out
and walking. Yes, I’ll stop there.

CF:

And in terms of the information on the infographic about the health risks
with this, was that something you’d thought about or that you were familiar
with?

Ivy:

Yes, I think I tend to actually…I don’t think I eat more healthily at home,
actually, I think I have got more access to biscuits and, you know, the teapot
is right there so if I want coffee or tea then you can just go and get it

1

straightaway. I also tend to not prioritise lunchtimes as much, and so I’ll
just…the work will eat into other times and into that lunchbreak so I tend to
have a smaller lunch, unless it’s leftovers or anything.
CF:

Thank you, that’s really interesting. And Mia, do you want to come in there?
I think your hand was up next.

Mia:

Yes, it was. Hi. So I absolutely agree with everything that was said, so today
is my day at work and as you can see, if you want to see what I do, you can
see my…

CF:

I was wondering.

Mia:

…in the background. So basically I teach in the simulation lab so it’s about
acting out or role-playing emergency situations and stuff, and actually quite
a lot of the time, you’re standing, you’re role-playing a nurse or you’re
controlling the technology and then when you’re debriefing, you’re
debriefing a small group of people but it’s very interactive where you walk
and use a lot of your body language to teach, whereas when I’m home
which are my research days, I literally just sit. And I don’t have a space in
my house to work so I work on the kitchen table, so pretty much when it
comes to getting lunch, I just have to stand and walk over to the fridge which
is only about ten steps away and then come and sit down, whereas like
today I’ve gone for lunch with my work colleagues so I’ve had to walk to buy
that lunch because I’m never organised, and actually I feel the pressure
from my colleagues to eat healthily so I probably bought a much healthier
lunch than I would do at home. And at home, I’ve got two little kids and my
mother-in-law buys them lots of treats and stuff and they’ve recently had
COVID so we’ve got a massive package of chocolate and it’s just out of
boredom rather than hunger and actually to break up the monotony of just
sitting and just working at my kitchen table.

CF:

And are you aware of those messages in the infographic about the health
risks of sitting? Is that something that you had thought about previously?

Mia:

Yes, absolutely, and also I’m a doctor so on a Monday I work as a GP and
quite often I tell overweight people to eat more healthily and do more
exercise.

CF:

So that’s part of your role, I guess, really. That’s really, really interesting,
thank you. Rosie, do you want to come in there?

Rosie:

Yes, so I agree with…

CF:

Oh, I think you’ve gone back onto mute, Rosie.

Rosie:

Sorry, can you hear me?

CF:

Yes, we heard the start and then it just went back onto mute but we can
hear you now.

2

Rosie:

Sorry.

CF:

No, it’s okay.

Rosie:

So yes, I think just to add anything new to what’s already been said, I would
say that when I was in the office, I really made an effort every lunchtime to
get away from my desk whereas at home I do make an effort but maybe
two or three times a week at the most. Definitely I noticed at the beginning
of lockdown I was really making an effort and after about six months to nine
months, really there’s very little effort happening now in terms of actual
exercise. I run, I’m talking about like a proper run or a proper cycle, but I
tend to do more like just go to the shops which isn’t really that active.
Also I work longer hours from home because I’ll start earlier and it merges
more in, so I think because it’s actually over a longer period of time, I’m
maybe being less active and I’m not having the commute as has been said,
and in terms of I didn’t have a space, I was on the kitchen table, I’ve now
got a desk and in fact yesterday or the day before, my friend gave me a
standing desk.

CF:

Wow.

Rosie:

That’s going to be a bit different. So having equipment is a big thing, and in
terms of you were asking about the health thing, yes, totally, we all know
the health thing but I’ve noticed that from home I’ll just sit for such long
periods of time that I’ll get a dead leg and I wouldn’t get that in the office,
you know, because I’m crossing my leg or…what was the other thing I was
going to say? Just get really cold because I’m not moving, so not healthy,
oh dear, yes.

CF:

I dropped out there, I think, for the last wee bit, but I think I heard most of
what you were saying, so I think just in terms of a change in structure, really,
to our day and a lengthening of the working day, I think definitely I
would…yes, I think those are definitely themes that we’ve heard coming out
from others as well, so yes, thank you. Lucy, do you want to come in next?

Lucy:

Yes, thanks. Yes, I was just going to say looking at the infographic, I was
aware of the physical health impacts of sitting but not so much the mental
impacts and like I think I’ve heard a lot about mental wellbeing but it’s mainly
been like linked to isolation of working at home but not really sitting, so it’s
quite interesting, because I’ve had quite, I think, trouble sleeping and stuff,
and it’s maybe been because I’ve not been active enough, so I thought that
was quite interesting. I was also kind of shocked at the 89 per cent of time
spent at home even though I would say that was representative of my time
at home.
And yes, like others were saying related to that, things like eating less
healthily and I think eating more often at home just as a kind of excuse to
get up and do something else that’s not sitting, and I think also like the dead

3

leg and stuff, being at home being alone, I sit in a worse position than I
might in the office because you sit in the sofa, sit cross-legged or
something, and then end up doing that for a couple of hours and you’ve got
dead knees.
CF:

We’re sort of losing our reasons to move and the opportunities to move and
yes, I think just the physical side of it, as you say, we need to be quite
mindful of, I think. Evie, do you want to come in now?

Evie:

Yes, I felt the information on the infographic, all of that sounded familiar,
was aware of it and especially I think of the mental health aspect because
that was something that was difficult for me, not just necessarily the
isolation but not being much of a morning person, knowing that when I go
into the office, I have to get up at a certain point and I have to get ready and
go through the motions of I am now entering the world and missing that, not
having that, and basically you could get up two minutes before work started
in your pyjamas and just get going, that was not something that was very
helpful. So yes, I think definitely difficult and it definitely resonated with me
when I read about it.
I also noticed, which was not on the infographic, that because of working at
home, when you’re working in the office, I think you naturally break up your
screen time a little bit because at least my job, you have colleagues, and
you will chat and you will ask each other for advice, and you might go on a
little tea break or just whatever, and that doesn’t really happen at home,
because you’re just on a screen and then you have meetings with people
but they’re not in person, they’re again on a screen, and so my eyesight
has got worse because of that and has really been affected since the
pandemic started. So that’s something I’ve noticed that was not
necessarily…I didn’t notice on the infographic was it can affect people’s
eyesight as well.

CF:

Yes, so we’re focusing on sitting but actually it’s linked to what we’re
hearing about eating habits, about screen time, eyesight, that period of
sitting at a desk is linked to other health behaviours as well, so yes, that’s
really interesting. Harper, do you want to come in next?

Harper:

Yes, so I was just going to say, so in my work people are writing reports so
we’ve always had an issue with people just sat at their desks at their
computers and just not moving so I was quite familiar with the stuff about
sitting down and the risks and it’s something that we’ve been working on
wellbeing weeks every year to try and get people moving more, and it’s
always been a challenge, like always been a challenge. I think I’m in a really
weird situation that I’ve been working from home one day a week for a long
time as a reasonable adjustment because I’ve got arthritis so I used to have
one day at home sitting down and it was a rest and it helped with pain and
stuff, and now it’s the other way and I’m going to the office sometimes, and
I’m finding I’m saving up jobs, I guess, for when you’re in the office so I’m
running about, and I come home and I’m exhausted.

4

So when I’m at home, I’m much more conscious of trying to move around
more, especially we split and sometimes I’m in the kitchen and sometimes
I’m here, so when I’m in the kitchen I’m very conscious that I need to move.
I’ve got a standing desk in the kitchen but it’s just making yourself do it I
think is the problem. So as part of wellbeing initiatives we’ve had stretch
alerts and I’ve sent people five-minute yoga videos and it’s like a different
one every Monday morning and people love them, they really enjoy them,
but when I’m not sending the 11 o’clock reminder, I don’t know how many
people are doing it, and even I am like, oh, I’m going to do that as well, and
totally don’t do it.
So it’s like I know exactly what I need to be doing but it’s hard to make
yourself or allow yourself time to do it, when you’re supposed to be doing
other things.
CF:

Yes, the motivation side of it and I think just the demands on our time…

Harper:

Yes, I think everybody is just…I feel like everyone’s working longer…I’m
definitely not working smarter but I’m definitely working longer and yes, it’s
right, nobody’s looking at you so you can sit hunched or you can sit like that
and you wouldn’t do that in the office, and you definitely get interrupted
more in the office.

CF:

Mia, do you want to come in quickly and then we’ll move on to the next
question?

Mia:

Yes, thanks. Yes, I totally agree with that. It’s about knowing what you
should do but not actually doing it. So I got myself a Fitbit to try and do
10,000 steps but it hasn’t helped. I just go, oh, I haven’t done that many.

CF:

Yes, I think just having that can really help you but 10,000 steps is quite a
big number, I think, I find when I’m working at home it’s difficult to get your
step count up. Right, I’m just going to pass over to Divya who’s going to
take us through the second question. I’m aware we’ve already touched on
some elements to do with the second question, Divya, but I’ll let you take
over.

DS:

Yes, thank you, everyone, that was so interesting to hear from all of you.
And as Claire said, you’ve talked about some of these aspects, but I thought
we could reflect a little bit more on these sitting behaviours specifically and
think about are you sitting more or less at home than when you were in the
office and of course what influences this. So some of the things that you
guys have been saying is the commute to work has affected some of the
sitting while working from home, the less movement at home in terms of
your commute to the kitchen and toilet and things like that, and also the
breaking up screen time from social interactions. So if you want, is there
anything else you can think of that’s influencing sitting while working from
home? And if you want to elaborate on some of the things you’ve said as
well.

5

The only thing is, Claire, because I’m sharing my screen I can’t see anyone
who’s putting up their hand so if you’re okay to just call on people, feel free
to jump in.
CF:

Yes, I think Lucy is the first one with their hand up, Divya, so do you want
to go ahead, Lucy?

Lucy:

Oh, thanks, yes. I was just going to agree with I think I definitely sit a lot
more when I’m at home and a lot of that’s because of the small movements
that you do in the office so like walking to get a coffee or going outside for
lunch or walking to meetings and stuff, so that’s definitely had an impact.
But I think as well, I don’t know if this is related, but having all the meetings
on Zoom and on screen can be really exhausting. I think I’m much more
likely after work working at home to go and sit on the sofa after work rather
than go out for a walk or something, whereas if I was in the office, I’d maybe
feel a bit more energised to go and do something else after work so maybe
it has that kind of knock-on effect as well.
And also the commute and everything, I used to bike into work and I
obviously don’t do that anymore, so that kind of thing.

CF:

Yes, I think Mia is next, Divya.

DS:

Go for it, Mia.

Mia:

Sorry, yes, that thing about meetings, so when you’re at work, you’re
physically in, then at least you have to move physically from one room to
the other depending on where the meeting is, whereas when you’ve got
online meetings I literally, if I’m working from home and teaching students
with a click of two buttons I go from one teaching thing to another, whereas
before I used to have to walk from one tutorial room to maybe a lecture
theatre and at least I don’t have to do that. And it’s the same with getting
lunch, I just have to walk two steps towards my fridge as opposed to going
to the canteen.

DS:

Absolutely, completely related to that about the meetings as well as the
walking at home as well.

CF:

So it’s Ivy, Evie and then Harper.

DS:

Ivy, if you are happy to jump in?

Ivy:

Yes, so I was just going to say that actually I found working from home,
there are some positives in terms of I would find it depends on how many
times a week it would happen because when I went into work, like some
people have said, if I go into work, I usually get more tired when I come
back and then the next day it will be a nice thing to work from home because
it is like a rest, and in some ways then I suppose you could take that as the
next day when you’re working from home, you don’t actually go out and
walk or anything because you are sort of resting for the days that you’re

6

going back into work. But when it happens to be that you’re working from
home most days of the week then it becomes quite…I find it mentally quite
draining and I have noticed actually that the more breaks I take in between
tasks, the less I’m tired at the end of the day. I think the more screen time I
spend actually the more tired I am, so it is a mixture. It’s like a balance
between being very active at work and being tired for that reason as
opposed to having screen time and feeling tired, so it’s just trying to get rid
of the tiredness, really.
DS:

Right, very interesting, and in terms of your sitting specifically, do you know
what is influencing your sitting when you’re at work versus when you’re at
home?

Ivy:

So when I’m in work I send equipment supplies to the sites that are
recruiting for the trials so a lot of that’s quite physical work. I mean, I
wouldn’t describe it as exercise but you’re sort of moving about and also if
the printer’s upstairs… I actually go to a different printer so that I have to
actually do the stairs and things like that. You think, oh, I can go and see
my colleague and that will add in some steps and also break up the day.
There’s different tasks like that where I have to go and see people or
meetings and that will definitely get me up and about, but, like people have
said, you know, having meetings on Zoom, you just end up sitting a lot of
the time at home.

DS:

Thanks for that, Ivy. Evie, are you happy to jump in?

Evie:

I thought about this a lot and I think in the end I’m probably sitting the same
amount of time whether I’m working from the office or working from home
or at least was, so when I was working from home all the time, so I’m back
to a bit more hybrid working since the last two weeks, and if I was just at
home, I’ve found that I needed to just go on a walk during my lunchbreak
and I needed to work out somehow after work because I just have this pentup energy from sitting. In the workday, I usually walk to work so I’ve got the
commute into work and back, and then in the building because the building
is quite big itself and it’s like people said, you take the longer way to the
printer or you take the long route to the loo, which in my flat it’s not big, the
long route is still just ten yards.
So I think in the end it probably comes down to the same amount of sitting
but I found that at home it can go either way what kind of sitting it is, like
when I am mentally not well sometimes I just want to work from the couch
and that is not a great way to sit all day long, and other days when I feel
quite disciplined about how I want to sit, it feels quite nice to be at home
because it means that I have more flexibility, I don’t just have to sit at my
desk. Sometimes I find it really nice to be able to sit on the floor and work
from the floor with a little low table and that feels really good on my back
which is something I don’t do when I go into the office.
So I think, yes, there’s a balance between the two which is why I also quite
like the hybrid working now because I get the best of both worlds a little bit.

7

DS:

That’s really interesting that when you are working from home you were
aware of the fact that you might be sitting more and you were breaking it up
with some lunchtime walks and walking more after work as well, and the
change in posture that you mentioned while working from home that you
were aware and you did a lot of that, that was interesting as well. Thanks
for that.

Evie:

Yes, no problem.

DS:

Harper, are you happy to come in?

Harper:

Yes, hi. So I was just thinking what kind of influences sitting more at home
and I think, for me, anyway, work is really pushing hybrid and flexible
working so they say if you want to work compressed hours that’s fine, if you
want to take two hours out to do a gym class, that’s all good, and they’re
really, really encouraging that, so I’m taking time out of my day to do online
classes and sometimes go for a swim. But then I realised that as soon as I
get home, I’m like, oh my god, I can’t move, we’re also on flexitime, I don’t
know if anyone else has flexitime but you literally are counting the minutes,
like oh my god, I’ve been clocked out for an hour so I need to work…I’m
working slightly longer days anyway, I need to work, I can’t stop until six,
and you feel like you need to sit and slog away for a bit longer.
So although I’m doing maybe bigger movement for an hour a couple of
times a week, it’s the lots of little movements so then I find I’m kind of getting
stiff and sore.

DS:

That’s really interesting, the difference between the bigger movements and
the smaller movements that you have over the day. I can’t see if anyone
else wants to come in.

CF:

I think we’ve got Rosie and Lucy but I’m just wondering, Divya, we’ll maybe
move onto the third question if that’s okay with Rosie and Lucy, just in the
interests of time. So just with the third question, I think we’ve already
covered a little bit of this, and thinking about what would be a good idea to
break up your sitting, so Harper mentioned about these yoga breaks that
you’re offering and Mia mentioned about getting a Fitbit, and then within the
work environment, Ivy was talking about using different toilets or taking the
stairs with a different route, but thinking about your home environment, is
there anything that we haven’t already talked about that you think would be
a good idea to break up your sitting and even if you haven’t tried it yourself?
So, Rosie, great, you go first, I’ll not leave you off this time, thank you.

Rosie:

No, it’s fine. So what I was going to say is that I think with working from
home it’s great because you’ve got that flexibility that has been mentioned,
you can try and be healthy, but I think the big thing about working from
home is the lack of self-motivation, so something that we can do to motivate
ourselves or to be conscious and aware that’s actually a reminder, I need

8

that because literally that’s where I’m failing. And I mean, I’m quite a
motivated person.
And the other thing that I wanted to say in terms of ideas is feet, so I find
that I am quite often just in socks and I don’t have shoes or slippers and
that is not good for posture at all, so that’s a really big thing, and also music,
because I’m not in the office, I can put on music sometimes if I’m not having
to really strategise, so if I’ve got music on, I tend to move to that, so that
was another idea I had somehow. Anyway, that’s me.
CF:

Great, those are really…and I’m definitely aware of that, I feel like I’ve spent
two years in my slippers, and I think just that whole process of getting
yourself ready for movement and music I think is a great idea. Mia, do you
want to come in?

Mia:

Yes, thank you very much. For me, I work to a lot of deadlines, and so I
think sometimes I think, oh, if I don’t take a break and just carry on and
motor on, I’ll get this done earlier and then I’ll have time to do something,
but actually then I realise that actually things don’t…you know, I never do
have enough time to do something. But to me, when I’m working from
home, I just have to please myself and what I find is that my responsibility
to others really motivates me so actually if I arrange to do something with
someone I will keep that appointment. I hate cancelling on people. And so
that can be a real motivator, whereas if I promise something to myself, I
often just don’t bother.

CF:

Yes, so actually having that link with someone else and an arrangement in
place, yes, great. Lucy, do you want to come in?

Lucy:

Yes, thanks. Yes, it was kind of similar to Mia point, actually, I was going to
say that something…well, I’ve found it quite difficult to motivate myself to
go on walks and get out of the flat and it’s quite easy to just be like, oh, I’ll
go later, I’ll go later, and then you never go, and so trying to schedule a
walk with a friend or my sister or something, that’s often the only way that
I’ll actually make sure I go outside.
And I think also similar to slippers, I find some days when you’re lacking
motivation, you’ll just sit in your pyjamas or sit in tracksuit pants or
something, and actually getting dressed into proper clothes, that makes me
feel a bit more like you’re ready to go outside, you’re ready to get up and
do stuff and you feel a bit more like you’re actually at work and not just
sitting on your couch.
And one other thing was that I did have an app on my phone, kind of at the
start of lockdown, I don’t know how well it worked but I used it for a while
and every 20 minutes it would give me a reminder to stand up, and so some
days that worked really well and some days I just snoozed it all day. But
yes, it was something that I tried.

9

CF:

Great, thank you. So getting ready to move, like being prepared to move
and then having that reminder, those are good suggestions, thank you.
Harper?

Harper:

It’s not a very exciting suggestion but doing housework. It’s more out of
necessity. So while he’s away at nursery at lunchtime if I can scrub the bath
or something, it’s quite handy but I’ve tried to build that in as, you know,
obviously useful in life but as a movement thing. I’m like running switching
the washing machine on or hanging out the washing, things like that, you
are moving a bit, but you’re not away from your desk too long.

CF:

Yes, definitely. I think just having those reasons to move, they’re different
at home than what they are in the office. Ivy, do you want to come in now?

Ivy:

Yes, I think just scheduling the time, I used to have a Fitbit and it used to
tell me if I was sitting for too long, it would buzz, and now I have a Garmin
and it tells me when my goal’s been reached a certain number of steps, so
it’s slightly different. But yes, having those reminders are helpful but also I
think when you’re up and doing stuff, maybe just forcing yourself to stay up
for longer or at the start of lockdown, I was really paranoid about sitting for
too long and so when I’d get up, I’d do ten squats or something to add on
to what I was already doing.
Yes, just like scheduling that time like at lunchtime making sure, instead of
taking a break to go to food, doing it for other reasons like having half an
hour for a walk and then the rest for lunch.

CF:

Yes, do actually protect that time and there’s definitely things from lockdown
that we want to keep. In that early phase of lockdown, there were things
that we really did to focus on our wellbeing that maybe we’re not keeping
and I think it’s really important to reflect on that and what we could bring
back. Mia, I’ll pass over to you and then we’ll move onto the next bit, so do
you want to come in now? Oh, I think you’re on mute, Mia.

Mia:

Thank you. Something that some of my friends did was get a pet and
actually that really helps because it’s that responsibility to others, isn’t it, the
fact that you have to walk your dog.

CF:

Yes, definitely and it gets you out all year, like we’ve definitely heard
seasonal influences and it’s harder in the winter and I think there’s things
that really do force you out of the house and a dog is one of them. And lots
of people have got a dog in lockdown, I think. Right, I think we’ll maybe
move on now, Divya, yes, thank you.
So what we’re going to do as just a last task with you, we’ve been looking
at the literature in terms of what other researchers have used in different
interventions or programmes with people who are working in an office
environment and we’re just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of
whether these things would work at home with your employer. So we’re
thinking about providing people with some education around sitting or

10

sedentary behaviours and the health consequences, whether or not we
could give people feedback on the time they spend sedentary, and as we’ve
already talked a little bit about today, thinking about prompts around
movement. So do you think these are things that realistically might work
with your employer and might work when you’re working at home?
Rosie, you’re nodding, do you want to tell us what you think?
Rosie:

Yes, I think, you know, you could just provide some web links for the
education. I think people are pretty…especially people that work in
university, they’re pretty clued up, they know the stuff already but I think the
USP might be if it could be individualised somehow, so maybe you do
something that’s like a Microsoft form and then you get individual, not really
but kind of individual knowledge, I think that’s an added value, like just
giving somebody a web link, are they really going to read it? But if it’s
individual they’re more likely to, and regular prompts is a definite yes from
me, that’s me.

CF:

Okay, great, thank you. It’s good to get your perspective in your marketing
background, like actually how to individualise things is really interesting. Ivy,
I think you were next?

Ivy:

I think the equipment as well, like I know I was considering trying to stand
to work and at the moment, I mean, I’m just using a laptop and I think just
the posture, the occupational health measurements that you’d usually get
at work, it’s difficult to implement that in terms of having your feet on the
ground, looking up rather than down at a screen, yes, just I don’t know how
to finance that for everyone but it’s getting all of those things in place, like
the infrastructure in place and maybe like the yoga classes, just organising
something on a regular basis so that people will join.

CF:

Yes, and just what level of support different employers might be able to
provide, I think, and yes, it might be that, as you said, a range of options
that we give, for example, yoga classes or it might be that some employers
could consider different workstations in the home environment. Who was
next? I think Lucy, do you want to come in?

Lucy:

Yes, thanks. What was I going to say? Yes, I think it was Harper who said
about the emails in the morning with a prompt to stretch, I think that’s a
really good idea because it takes the onus of you to do it yourself. I think as
well in my work we had a couple of wellbeing weeks and they were really
good and we had a lot of information about sedentary, like sitting all the
time and ways to get over it and that was really good for the time it lasted,
but then it was like for one week a year and it just dropped off, and I think
for a few weeks afterwards everyone was really into it and stuff, and then it
just went back to normal. So maybe making it a bit more consistent would
be good in some way, I don’t know how you’d do that.

CF:

Yes, the timing of all of this, that you don’t want to overwhelm people but at
the same time I think we do need a bit of a reminder that this behaviour we

11

do need to be thinking about, so that’s really interesting, thank you. Harper,
do you want to come in?
Harper:

Yes, I was just thinking in terms of the education, I think it needs to be on
an individual persona level but also aimed at management and health and
safety because definitely for me looking at my risk assessments, people
being chained to their computers sat down all day is my biggest risk for
working from home for the whole organisation and when I was explaining
that to a manager and I was thinking, oh, they’re going to think I’m really
silly but then they were, like, okay, actually, I see, but I don’t know what we
can do about that. So it’s kind of getting people to take it seriously that
people sitting down for too long is an issue and it’s going to cost
organisations money in the long run because people are going to go off sick
and things.
And regular prompts, I think again that needs to be individualised, some
people really…my manager has got a watch and it keeps telling her to do
things and she gets rings, I don’t really get what she’s doing but it beeps all
the time. I find that really, really disruptive, and I hate that sort of thing. She
loves it. So I don’t think I could think of a regular prompt, you can get
programmes on computers to ping everybody’s computer at the same time
every half an hour or something. That would drive me bananas and it’s
trying to find…it all needs to be individual but how do you make something
that’s individual for everybody? It’s really hard.

CF:

Yes, and I guess just it might be linked to what we were talking about earlier,
it might be that you need some of these things to change behaviour but
then you might not need the prompt forever more, but it is, I guess, that it’s
frequent enough that people don’t slip back into the behaviour again. Mia, I
think did you have your hand up there?

Mia:

I did, but it was all about making it individualised so if the prompt comes at
nine o’clock in the morning and every nine o’clock in the morning you’ve got
a debrief or you’ve got some sort of meeting then that’s not going to be very
helpful, so just really tailoring it to the person is going to make it most
effective, I think. And also about, you know, you’re not going to be telling
somebody who runs marathons who perhaps is sitting too much during the
working day to just go for a five-minute walk whereas somebody who
perhaps is more limited mobility-wise so kind of when, how much, what kind
all needs to be targeted. And actually to be fair, I think it might be easier to
individualise then it kind of sounds, perhaps with a questionnaire or
something, and then that questionnaire then designs when and what the
prompts are. I don’t know.

CF:

Yes, I think you’ve basically raised our research agenda for the next
however many years. It sounds quite straightforward but as you’ve just said
it’s actually enormously complicated that people do engage with it and it’s
useful. Lucy, did you want to come in there, really quickly, just before we
finish?

12

Lucy:

Yes, sorry, I just had one other point I just thought of. I was thinking about
the prompts and how I think, well, yes, they’d probably have to be
personalised and individually, but I think personally for me if it came from
my organisation, I’d know it was like a work email to be, like, remember to
stop and stretch or whatever, then it would feel like you’re a bit more
supported to do that whereas if you have to set it yourself and maybe take
time away from your computer, you’re maybe worrying about how much
time you’re taking and stuff like that. So yes, that’s all I wanted to say.

CF:

Yes, I think that’s a really important point, that organisational endorsement
of it all and that you know that you have buy-in from your employer is really
important. And Ivy just saying about nutritional information being important
and making sure a lot of movement at home is based on that rather than
actually exercising and I would totally agree with that. So I’m just scrolling
up through the comments, I think Sarah’s been keep tracking of those, so
we’ll capture all of that in the transcript, thank you. So Sarah, will I just pass
back over to you at this stage to wrap things up? Thank you very much,
everyone, for your contributions. It’s been fascinating and really helpful to
get your input.

SM:

Thanks, Claire and Divya, for facilitating that and thanks to you all, as Claire
has said, really you’ve been open and honest and we really appreciate that
very rich dialogue and indeed all your ideas, so thanks so much for your
input. It really is appreciated and it certainly has got us a lot to think about
now for our next steps.
So just in terms of what else we’re doing at the moment, we’ve got a couple
more focus groups. I think we’ve got two more, actually, we’ll have done six
in total and we’re doing those with employees or people who don’t line
manage any staff and also with groups of line managers so we’re getting
those two very different perspectives and then we’ll bring it all together at
some point in the future. Then I think in springtime, I can’t remember off the
top of my head, it’s something we’ve provisionally talked about but I’m going
to guess it’s sort of April, May time that we will be in touch with you again
to invite you to a workshop and at the workshop we will review all the
findings from the focus groups and we will present some of our preliminary
solutions that we’ve come up with following the discussions that have been
had at the focus groups.
So there is a thank you voucher, a very small token to show our appreciation
for your time today and I’ll be in touch with you very soon to organise that
and how to get that to you, and of course we’ll keep in touch with you with
updates about the project unless you ask us not to, so if you prefer that we
didn’t, just get in touch with me and let me know.
And then just a final thank you for your time and input today. We do say
that we’re still recruiting but we’re actually not, we’re full and we’re maxed
out now, so that’s really, really good to be able to say that at this early stage
in the project, but thanks so much for all your interest, and there’s a note of
our email addresses but do get in touch with me if you’ve got any questions

13

or want to follow up with any points from today if anything comes to you or
you’ve got any ideas or suggestions, do just send them on to me and our
Twitter handles, I think that’s the correct name for them, those are there
and do feel free to follow us because we will put some updates and
information about this work on Twitter too, so if you’re interested in keeping
in touch with developments in that way then please feel free to give us all a
follow.
So we’re bang on time, that’s really good and also kind of unusual, so
hopefully you have got a bit of a break between your next meeting or
whatever you’ve got to do next this afternoon, and you can get up and do
some inspirational stretching or movement or whatever has maybe been
talked about today and that you feel like trying out, that would be great, I’m
sure.
So thanks again and it was really lovely to meet you all and we’ll be in touch
again very soon.
CF:

Thank you very much, everyone.

DS:

Thank you.

All:

Thank you, bye.
