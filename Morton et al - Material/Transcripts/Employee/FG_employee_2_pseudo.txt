AN:

We’ve put together three key questions to shape our discussions and we’ll
just take you through each of these questions and ask for your input and
your views in relation to each of those. And the first question I’ll kick off with,
and then I’ll hand over to Sarah, but the first question was really, what did
you think about the information in the infographic about sitting and the
health consequences – was it new to you, was it something that you already
know about it? I’m just going to post in the chat a copy of the infographic if
you don’t have it to hand. Who’d like to kick off? Oliver?

Oliver:

No-one likes going first, do they? You’ll be pleased to know, given that I
studied at your place, that none of it was new to me. I think what it helped
to clarify in my mind were the very specific consequences and how diverse
those are and, I suppose, as well, the point about moving throughout the
day. As a person who used to play quite a bit of sport most of my activity
was usually condensed to quite short and intense bursts of activity and I
think as I’ve got older and less capable of playing sport, or my capabilities
to play sport have been realised to not be that good, then I’ve actually
spread that activity out over the day. And I think that probably fits closely
with what’s been highlighted in the infographic.

AN:

Thanks Oliver. Ella, I’m seeing your comment and I’ll try and address that
as well, thank you. Anyone else? Ava?

Ava:

So, it wasn’t really a surprise to me. I work in public health, so part of my
role is to try and encourage people to be active to reduce their risk of breast
cancer. I kind of worked around physical activity for a number of years. But
I think what sort of interests me is that, while my role is to promote physical
activity, it’s been quite challenging to try and encourage other staff in my
work place to be active during the day. And I actually find it very, very
difficult to do it as well, because you just find that you do sit a lot more when
you’re at home, yeah. And in answer to your next question, yes, I am
definitely sitting more at home than I was when I was in the office, for a
number of reasons but I won’t go into that just now but yeah, that’s my take
on it.

AN:

Okay, thank you Ava. Anyone else?

Harris:

Yes, me. So yes, I would say that... I would say that I’m sitting much more
frequently whilst I’m at home compared to in the office. Looking at the
infographic it’s something that I’m not particularly surprised about. With the
exception of cancer, I was very surprised about that, it’s not something that
I would have associated with sitting down for extended periods of time.

AN:

Okay, thank you. So, the specific consequences…I think Oliver as well said,
it kind of highlights the different consequences and cancer was maybe one
you weren’t familiar with. What about the others, were you aware of these
consequences of sedentary behaviour? James?
1

James:

Yeah, to be honest, similar to the other comments. With our organisation
[organisation name removed] we do promote physical activity through
active travel, so a lot of the, kind of, information with regards to the benefits
of being active we’re kind of aware of as well. So, it’s really, kind of, because
the sectors we work in it’s quite common knowledge.

AN:

Okay, great, thank you. Well, unless anyone else has anything they want
to share in relation to that question it sounds like it’d probably be good to
move on and understand a bit more about your experiences of working at
home. And Sarah, do you want to…? Firstly, does anyone else want to
come in on that before we move on? Okay, great. Sarah, would you like to
come in on the next question?

SM:

Yeah, thanks Ailsa. And obviously if anybody does have anything they want
to add at any point, you know, even if we’ve moved on please feel free to
use the chat because we’ll have a wee look at that either afterwards or, you
know, we’ll pull it back in during the rest of the focus group. But yes, so
thanks Ailsa.
Just moving on then to thinking about your own context and trying to reflect
on if you’re now while you’re working at home, or maybe if you’re in this
hybrid situation, do you feel like you’re sitting more or less than you were
when you were working in the office predominantly, most of your week
being spent in the office? And then also thinking about the things that might
influence that, and it might be some social influences, environmental
influences, it might be something, you know, just completely unexpected or
different. So, just have a wee think about your own context and if you’re
sitting, where it is and what kind of factors are influencing that.

Ella:

Yeah, just for myself I’m definitely sitting more than I was previously. So
previously I would cycle to work so that was about 45 minutes to an hour of
cycling every day. At work I was on my feet all day besides break times
and, you know, for some meetings with people we’d walk and have
meetings. Whereas now I’m obviously not commuting and I’m finding myself
sitting for all meetings, because it’s not as appropriate to go on walks, you
know, putting your camera on or you can’t leave the house due to sensitive
information being shared.
And I do find that I’ll do some exercise at my lunch breaks, so kind of things
like yoga or gentle walks around, but not really any higher intensity stuff,
nothing that really gets my heart rate increasing very much. And, you know,
just small walks to, like, the grocery store and stuff but I don't have the time
to do more intensive exercises or anything like that. So it has impacted me
quite a lot.

SM:

So, it sounds like there’s multiple factors there that are coming into play.
So, you’ve got a lack of time because of your work load, it sounds like it’s
not cultural to stand up or maybe have the walking meetings now that you’re

2

working at home. And also just environmental things – you don’t need to
cycle to your home office any more.
Ella:

Definitely, and I don’t have a standing desk in my small flat. I can move
around my house quite easily but all of those are in sitting positions, on my
bed, on my couch, and my desk or dining table are all needed. So yeah, it
is a large amount of factors.

SM:

Okay, that’s lovely, thanks Ella. And I think, Luca, if you want to come in, I
think you had your hand up and then we’ll go over to Sophie.

Luca:

Yes, I think I’m definitely sitting more at home because I’m waking up, the
computer’s right there, I’m straight onto work. I have an hour’s walk with the
dog at lunch time then I’m back to work. And it’s just so easy to work over
your allotted time because you’re right there, you know, there’s not that
distinct cut-off point where you’re having your commute to go back home.
So, I think I’m definitely sitting more because I’m at the computer more,
probably being more productive than being in the office, you know, the
procrastination kind of kicks in and you go and make that coffee and, oh I’ll
have another one, half an hour later. So, I think I’m sitting more definitely at
home than I would be in the office space.

AN:

Thanks Luca. And Sophie?

Sophie:

I would say I’m quite similar as well, that I’m sitting a lot more being at home
but I’m kind of getting out and exercising more in my lunch break. And we’ve
got a kind of company challenge at the moment to, like, win prizes and
basically test a new app that we’re hopefully going to launch and that’s, like,
encouraged me to get out. Especially it being winter I think it’s a lot easier
to just kind of stay inside and just not go out in general, especially if you are
working from home and you don’t really have the need to go anywhere. So
I think, by having something that’s forcing me to get out there and exercise
and that, kind of, like, team aspect as well is really good. And it’s something
which has been quite helpful, because before that I’ve kind of just been
staying inside for, like, days and days and I never used to be like that before
the pandemic and all of that as well.

SM:

Okay, thanks Sophie. That sounds like quite a collective thing, you know,
that there’s limited opportunity to move and you are feeling that you are
aware that you’re sitting longer than you would have done in the office. So,
I think that’s really good that that’s something that you are aware of. And
also, I think this group, just from the few people that have spoken, at lunch
break you seem to be doing something quite active on your lunch break, so
I think that’s really positive too. And Sophie, I’m really interested to see your
app and what comes, that sounds really interesting, so thanks for telling us
about that. So, Oliver, I’ll move on to you and then, Ava, I think you had
your hand up just a second after.

Oliver:

Yeah, I’ve definitely got some similarities to what’s already been said. I think
the change in commute to work has influenced that initial walk that I would
3

do to the train station, and then from the destination train station to our place
of work. What I’ve found is that I’ve filled in that time now by working out at
home before I turn the computer on. I probably do a shorter amount of time
but a higher intensity of activity in that period than I used to.
Throughout the day I think I feel a bit more tethered to the desk than I did
when I was at work; usually I’d have to move round the campus in order to
teach in different places and that would at least break up the day and I
would have some movement, even if relatively short. Because I’m working
at home the school drop-offs have become opportunities to do activity. So,
whilst it’s about a mile to go to the school, and typically in the mornings we’ll
take the car to do that journey, in the afternoons if I haven’t got too much
on then we’ll walk up and take the scooters so the kids can scoot back –
and that’s sort of been worked into the day.
And early on in the pandemic before we had a chance to really sort out the
technology that enabled some of the home working that we’re now doing,
I’d initially set up my laptop on an ironing board so that I could have a
standing desk and be a bit more active, I suppose, whilst sedentary. And
then yeah, I think because my wife and I have both been working from home
she’s been really great at mid-afternoon, sort of, prompting us or just after
lunch saying like, shall we go out for a quick walk? And we’ll maybe work
half an hour of a walk into the day – so again, picking up with people’s
points with this lunchtime-ish period being a really productive one in terms
of being able to get out and do some activity as well.
The final bit for me would be that because I wasn’t able to meet key
collaborators in the office to do my work, often we would agree to meet
outdoors and have a walking meeting. So, most of my PhD students, most
of my close co-authors are people that live within an hour’s journey of me
and so we would either, you know, meet in the middle or people would park
at their houses and then we would conduct, you know, an hour’s or an hour
and a half’s meeting whilst on the move. Which really actually came directly
from…I think it was when [Professor] arrived at [organisation name
removed] she suddenly changed, you know, the…or created a change in
thinking about how meetings could be conducted. And that’s directly where
I, you know, sort of said to my students, we might as well do this on the
move and have a go at it. And that’s made a big difference as well to those
meetings.
SM:

Thanks Oliver. I think that’s really interesting what you’re saying about the
ironing board, by the way because, you know, we do hear about the
standing desks being a great solution for alternate…we know you’re not
supposed to stand all day, you need to go between the two. But people who
live in small apartments or small spaces or share a flat don’t have those
kinds of spaces that they can add something potentially big into, and so it’s
great to hear that you’ve come up with something quite alternative.
[Professor], also, she came up with using a shelf on your bookshelf, on your
bookcase, so that’s quite a fun alternative, I guess. But yeah, thanks Oliver,
that’s great. And Ava, I’ll just bring you in now.

Ava:

I think some of my, sort of, issues around being less active now are similar
to everybody else’s, I mean, I lost my commute. I used to cycle from
[location removed] into [location removed] a few times a week and then if I
wasn’t doing that I would be walking from [location removed] down to
[location removed], when I was commuting by train. So that’s been the
biggest loss and I think I really miss my cycle. So I am trying and even
through the winter I’m trying to do a, sort of, what people are calling a fake
commute, but for me it’s just like getting outside before I start work because
I don’t feel like I’ve…I feel like I need to have that outside time before I start
my day in the office.
But just even simple things like I used to work on the third floor of a building
that didn’t have a lift, but I live in a single-storey house and the first for, like,
a year and a half I hadn’t really walked up a steep set of stairs and when I
did I was…I’m pretty active but I felt really out of breath because I was out
of the habit of walking up stairs. So, that was something that I hadn’t even
thought about missing out on. And the office is just bigger, like, the office is
bigger than my house, so if I want to get up from my desk and make a cup
of tea or go to the toilet you’re walking further than I would be in my own
home, so I think that is…
I think the thing that I struggle with is…I think somebody else mentioned
this about the end of the day and just not really having that, sort of, end and
it’s just quite easy to just keep doing a task even though it’s gone past when
you would normally finish. And if you’ve not got a train to catch or
somewhere to go it’s just dead easy just to sit there and think, well, I can
just finish in 15 minutes and what am I going to do now anyway? I’ll just be
making tea or watching telly or something. So, I think having…like, in the
summer I was quite good at arranging to meet somebody after work at a
certain time, which means that you have to get up and leave the desk. But
if you don’t have that, like others have said, it’s just easy to sit.

SM:

Yeah, thanks Ava. I totally recognise that, like, sometimes the evening
comes and you think, it’s dark outside and it’s raining and I’m not going to
go for a run or I’m definitely not going to go for a cycle in the dark and, you
know, what else is there to do? In Scotland quite often it’s the grocery store
or Ikea or something like that, but you can’t do that every day unfortunately
or it would be very expensive. Anyway so that’s great, thank you. So, I’m
conscious of time and keen to move on to the next question to make sure
that we stick to our schedule. So, just a final invite if anyone has any final
points on that before I pass back to Ailsa for the next question? Hi Ailsa.

AN:

I was really intrigued by a couple of things that were said, I mean, Oliver
talked about how his wife has sort of encouraged him to go walking. And I
think it was Ava, you mentioned your work colleagues and you’re trying to
encourage them to be more active. As a group do people feel that the
people around you are having an impact on whether you’re sitting more or
sitting less? Luca?

5

Luca:

I would say definitely, because my fiancée has a totally different type of job
to me, she works with horses and she’s out from morning till noon on her
feet everyday whereas I am doing all the driving, doing all the home-based
sitting down work, the cooking that kind of thing. So, I claim I don’t have
enough energy to do any major exercise after all that, but she has kind of
given me that kick to say, look, I’ve been on my feet all day and I can still
come back and do the cleaning and help around. So, I also have a threeyear-old daughter, so going out with her for a quick half an hour, hour’s run
around definitely has made me think throughout lockdown that you’ve got
to have that bit of oomph and get outside and do that bit of exercise.

AN:

Thanks Luca – being motivated at the end of the day is important. And Ava?

Ava:

I’d probably say that my colleagues don’t have any influence over how
active I am. None of us work close enough together to…live close enough
together to do anything together. But I also found it was really difficult to try
and motivate my own colleagues, and giving them ideas and putting stuff
up on our intranet and it just seem to fall on deaf ideas sometimes – so it’s
been a bit of a challenge.

AN:

Okay, thanks Ava. Anyone else want to come in before we go to the final
question? Oliver?

Oliver:

My work’s tried a few different initiatives. Because I work in a sport
department some students wanted to put on yoga sessions for staff. There
was some group exercise, things like an equivalent of a Joe Wick’s kind of
session that some of the students wanted to run, and initially staff joined in
with as well. I think that because it was always a scheduled and formal thing
it was challenging, depending upon each person’s individual schedules,
and then also because there were great pressures with child care and, I
suppose, what’s revealed and not revealed about your home working
environment. Being on screen was also an issue and I think people started
to find, as time wore on, more personal alternatives to joining in with the,
kind of, group stuff.
Especially, like, late into the lockdown I would try and go out really late at
night because it meant that I could get out and I didn’t have to worry about
the kids being in school and that kind of thing. You know, it was all kind of
sorted and it meant that the streets were pretty quiet and I could get a pretty
long walk in knowing that it was going to be, you know, outside of my time.
I think that sense that our usual access to physical activity had been taken
away to a degree, or the way that we were used to it, made me more keen
or determined to find other ways of being active, even if that meant, you
know, heading out for a walk at nine o'clock at night and yeah, probably
what I wouldn't have done previously.

AN:

Thanks, Oliver, I think you’ve very nicely taken us onto that final question
around what could we be doing to help us break up sitting. That was an
interesting example about a work place student-led group yoga session and
some interesting points around why it may or may not work. Does anyone
6

else have any ideas that work for you or you think could work for you,
around helping to break up sitting during the working day? Ella?
Ella:

Okay, yeah, as I mentioned earlier I have taken to doing more yoga more
frequently. I was always someone who did yoga prior to starting to work at
home, however, now I’ve taken it on board to do it every day, so doing, like,
30-day challenges and things like that has helped me remain more
consistent. I’ve also tried to seek out some other friends, and others that
live close by, who maybe have more flexible schedules. And I have a friend
who we go for walk once a week and that helps break up the day a little bit
because we want to get out in the day time rather than in the dark evenings.
These can sometimes be affected by weather, so if the weather’s a little bit
rubbish then we’ll take to a coffee shop and have cake and have more
sitting instead. So, it’s usually helpful but not always.

AN:

Thank you. That, sort of, social contracting with someone else, agreeing to
do it, can make sure it does happen. Thanks for sharing that. Anyone else
got any other thoughts about what helps you break up your sitting during
the working day? Oliver?

Oliver:

Yeah, I think a couple of things for me. One is something I never used to
do – I now schedule email time, so I don’t look at my emails first thing in the
morning and I have, like, an hour window where I’ll look at those usually
around lunchtime. And I felt like, as soon as I put my emails on I was kind
of then fitting into the sort of cycle of replying and reciprocal back and
forward, whereas to leave them off meant that I didn’t open my emails first
thing in the morning and then feel sucked into this, kind of, continuous
presenteeism for the rest of the day just in case the people got back to me
and so on. So, kind of allocating some time for that has made a huge
difference to it.
And then second thing is that my work actually came up with some
principles that they wanted to be applied generically. And this was initially
a product of the Athena Swan process that we went through, and it was
built around helping to do childcare, so that was that you couldn't schedule
meetings between nine and ten, or between 2.30 and four o’clock. And then
there were some principles around the way in which the timetables for our
teaching were figured out, which meant that there was always a break
somewhere in the day that would allow you to have a lunch, even though
we don’t have a formal lunch break, if you know what I mean.
And what I think it’s enabled me, and I’ve spoken to other people who’ve
felt the same, to do is that where previously they wouldn't have time
necessarily to get up, or they wouldn't want to get up early enough to work
out then get the train to work, or commute to work, and then be at work is,
because there aren’t any meetings usually till ten o'clock, that time is now
seen as a window of opportunity, having dropped the kids off, to fit in a
quick workout, or sometimes I’ll do a yoga session. And then again, those
middle of the day and end of the day periods are times that are, sort of, ripe
with opportunity to do some physical activity.
7

So, I think organisations and colleagues discussing what would be
beneficial to them in terms of…and agreeing and recognising the benefits
of building time into the day that facilitates not only physical activity but
other things that are important in life, and recognising the value of those
things giving them time, has been really important. And then also, being
conscious of the things that usually suck me in and keep me locked to the
seat, if you know what I mean, those have been really valuable in changing
some of my habits, yeah, in terms of physical activity.
AN:

Thanks Oliver, that’s fascinating how you’ve individually organised yourself
but also how your organisation’s procedures have supported that as well. I
can see Luca coming in here.

Luca:

I agree with what Oliver said there. I’m going to move on to a hybrid working
approach from next month and I’ve scheduled in that I’ll work nine till half11 on Monday, Wednesdays, Fridays and then have that break and then
come back, work from half-one until finishing time. And on Tuesdays and
Thursdays I’m not going to start work until half-12 and work right up until
late in the evening. That’ll give me more time with my daughter, it’ll mean I
don’t have to worry about paying two extra mornings of nursery. And it’ll
allow me to get up and out and about more – even if it’s just going to Asda’s
in the morning and doing that hour/hour and a half shop, I’m still out and
about and doing that.
I’m going to try and fit in some gym time – I’ve never stepped inside a gym
in my whole life. So you know, but as Oliver said, you’ll have that time, you
don’t have time any constraints to worry about to get back for that meeting
starting in half an hour. So, I think changing your work patterns, if your work
is flexible enough with it and trialling it – I think I’ve tried about six in the
whole of the time we’ve been locked down – and just trying to get it to suit
me personally, and the work place, is definitely a good option.

AN:

Thanks Luca. I think we’re hearing of lots of opportunities that have come
out of this forced change in working through COVID. I’m just reading Ava,
yeah, so thanks Ava, you’ve a garden and you’re looking for, sort of, short
tasks that you can do during the day that give you that sort of burst of activity
and take you away from the desk. That’s a lovely example. Would anyone
else like to come in here? Before we move on, could…? Oh Sorry, Ava?

Ava:

Something that I haven’t actually tried but we did try it in the office well
before lockdown for a day, I think it was like Get Upstanding day – our IT
manager put an alarm every hour on everybody’s Outlook calendar and it
went off the hour and everybody was irate in our main office in [location
removed] because they’re always being told to stand up. But just something
to even just do a couple of times a day because it’s so easy to just get
sucked in and have a reminder, but I’ve never done it, so… I should, but it’s
one of those things that I keep thinking I should do but I don’t.

8

AN:

Thank you, that idea of a prompt that will encourage you to stand up. Ella,
are you…sorry, not Ella. Sophie, are you happy to tell us a wee bit more
about the app idea?

Sophie:

Yeah, sure. So, [organisation name removed] own [smartphone app name
removed], it kind of like sits side by side almost. And smartphone app name
removed] is already a game that people, like councils and different partners
and stuff, can sign up for in all different areas round the country. And
currently, like, they use cards and fobs and there’s speed boxes which are
attached to lamp-posts and people will either, like, walk, they’ll run, they’ll
cycle and they’ll get points. And it’s spilt, kind of, like, into schools and
communities, individuals, so there’s all different kinds of groups of people
that can get involved. And with the new app we’re trying to, like, expand it
even further.
So we tend to have, like, game phases so, like, this upcoming phase we've
got four different games. In Scotland, we’ve got one in [location removed],
so that’ll be, kind of, in the local area there. But with this new app we’re
hoping to expand it more to, kind of, like, the corporate side as well. So, on
the app itself you’ll have, like, the virtual beat boxes that you can swipe and
they’ll be, like, half a mile away from each other so you have to get out
there. And then you can be put into a team or you can do it individually and
then obviously if you’re in a team you’ve got that team aspect – if you want
to win you want to be at the top. And there’s also gems that you can collect,
which are slightly different but they kind of help boost your score as well.
But it’s basically encouraging people who may not have been active to get
out and try and either walk, cycle, run and just kind of explore their local
community and start living a more kind of active lifestyle, and hopefully
continue that after it’s finished. Because the games themselves are usually,
like, five to six weeks kind of thing, so we try and just encourage people to
actually get out there and then to continue that afterwards. It’s quite
complicated but that’s…

AN:

No, that was very clear, and you could see how if in your work organisation
you’re doing it for those six weeks, then that could be a stimulus to
encourage movement throughout the working day. Thank you, that’s really
interesting, we may well come back to you to find out a bit more again.
Sarah, are you happy to move on to the next slide?

SM:

Yeah, sure. Okay, so thanks for that really useful discussion and just being
so open and honest about your experiences over the past wee while of
working from home, really appreciate it. So, we started this project back in
August, and over the past few months we have been doing some review
work of published evidence and studies that looked at interventions or
solutions or strategies to break up sitting in the office environment.
And so, our review we were very stringent in what we were looking for and
it was about these interventions that had been effective in breaking up
sitting in office-based populations, so people who spend a lot of time sitting
9

where they're working in the office. And we identified somewhere between
10,000 and 11,000 papers – I try not to break out in a sweat when I think
about it – but over the months we were together to whittle it down to 24
papers that met our criteria. And from that we then condensed and grouped
all the different types of interventions, intervention components and
mechanisms for delivery and we’ve come up with six. And we are
presenting three of those to you to day.
So, we’ve got work place initiatives, and that might be things like standing
and walking meetings, and some of you have already talked about that
today. And also the challenges – that might be another work place initiative
– and also those kind of processes that Oliver talked about that have been
implemented. We also have bee looking at supportive working events, so
that might be things like your standing desk. It may be the behaviour of
others and how that influences the time that you spend sitting. And of
course role models – so if your manager’s doing it or your manager’s
encouraging a type of behaviour, are you more likely to engage with it? And
then training and support to help you to break up the time that you spend
sitting, and that might be things like what to do, how to do it and when to do
it.
So, we would like to know what you…how do you think these kinds of
interventions that have been effective in offices, how could they work in the
home environment, or be translated to the home environment, so really just
some of your feedback on that would be really useful. Hi Sophie.
Sophie:

Hi. Back when the pandemic started, I know…I think [organisation name
removed] gave employees, like, an extra 20 minutes to go out and go for a
walk within their kind of, like, schedule working hours. So, maybe something
like that could be an option when you’re working from home still, because
you know that other people in the business are kind of still going out and
hopefully getting that 20 minutes walk or, like, if they did yoga or just had a
break from sitting down and stuff. So, maybe if you’re knowing that the
whole team’s doing it, it might kind of encourage you to participate as well.

SM:

Excellent, thank you, thanks Sophie. And Luca?

Luca:

Yeah, I’ll take a slightly different tack to that. I think…I've just started a new
role and I was told that everyone in the office was allowed to take their
computer chairs, their desks even if wanted, and their chairs, whereas I had
to go and buy a new computer desk from Ikea and find a chair second hand
somewhere. And I do think if working from home is going to be a more
common thing, for the sake of my back I would definitely invest in a better
computer chair, and I would certainly hope that my employer would assist
in the funding of that item.
I’ve never heard of the idea of standing or walking meetings before, so that
was quite enlightening to me, and I would definitely partake in a walking
meeting with people who want to do so. Or even a joined meeting where
you knew everybody was standing, and you could take that ten minutes at
10

the beginning of the meeting to talk about anything other than work so
people are getting that, kind of, social interaction. We have a morning chat
where it’s ten minutes and you can just pop in and say good morning to
everyone, and then we have a tea break chat at about 11 o’clock which
people can just jump into and it’s forbidden to talk about anything related to
work. And I think those are the types of thing that have been missed
potentially through lockdown – that checking on how your colleagues
actually are, and I think that’s an important part of happiness within the work
place.
SM:

So, a bit of peer support there, Luca, as well as having your employer
provide you with the mechanisms to, you know, break up your sitting or to
sit less, just the people around you need to encourage you to engage with
it all as well. That’s great. What about the training and support, is that
something that would be useful to have? Because I think potentially people
need to know why they're doing these things, and why has a standing desk
arrived from my employer, and why am I being encouraged to do walking
meetings, or break up my day through a prompt or whatever. It’s like, would
the training be useful? Oh sorry, Ava, your hand’s up, I didn’t realise – come
on in.

Ava:

It’s okay, I put it up when you started talking. But I was going to go back to
role modelling, and I think that’s really important if you’ve got a culture and,
sort of, leaders doing the physical activity then I think it makes it more
culturally acceptable. So, we don’t really tend to have walking meetings, I
don't know why and it just doesn’t seem to have been something that got
started.
But somebody mentioned about the 20 minutes extra at lunch time, and as
part of our [organisation name removed] group we did ask our chief
executive to try and encourage people to take the time in the winter,
particularly, to take maybe, like, an extra 20 minutes/half an hour at
lunchtime to get the outside daylight time, and if they would kind of take that
back and maybe work a bit later into the evening or start a bit earlier. But,
just having that come from the chief executive seemed to give people
permission to do it, but yeah, without the leadership or role models then it
becomes quite challenging.

SM:

Yeah, and I think it’s that accountability to sort of manage your own time
and emulate what those above you are doing too, and the kind of strategies
that they’re adhering to. So, that’s great. And Sophie has put in the chat
that the training would be useful. Any ideas of how that would be best
delivered while you’re working at home, because obviously we can’t do inperson training sessions and things have sort of merged to become these
MS teams, like, training or maybe just an e-learning resource that you work
through yourself or something like that, or just a one pager maybe?

Sophie:

I think just something really simple that people can kind of glance over quite
quickly would be quite good, because you obviously don’t want to take up
too much time from people’s day, and if you can get it out quite simply to
11

them that’d be good. If you just did, like, a nice infographic or something
like that, that could be quite useful. Or you could maybe do, like, some kind
of webinar potentially that people could drop in and if it’s recorded they
could kind of view it any time they want to maybe.
SM:

Perfect, thanks Sophie. So, I see the reminder that there’s five minutes left
in the meeting and I think there’s less than that now – so, just to invite any
final comments on these active strategies from offices, before I hand back
to Ailsa to close off for today. I’ll just hand over to you then, thanks.

AN:

No problem at all. Thanks so much everybody, and so interesting to hear
everybody’s experiences and you’ve given us lots of food for thought. What
we’re doing is, we’re running a series of focus groups, you’re number two
of three, with employees. But we’re also really keen to line managers, we’ve
got three focus groups lined up with them. And we've been hearing from
today that the organisational processes and role models from those who
are leaders in the work environment is important for any intervention to
work, I think.
So, that’s our next steps and through the rest of January and into February.
Then we have a workshop planned for spring, where we’ll bring back all of
our findings, present some preliminary solutions. And if you’d like to be
involved with that, we would be very much appreciative of your involvement
in that session as well. Sarah will be in touch with the thank you voucher, a
token of our appreciation. We very much are so grateful that you’ve given
up this hour this afternoon and shared, as Sarah said, so honestly your
experiences. We will keep in touch with you with updates on the project,
unless you contact us and ask us not to, otherwise we’ll let you know how
we’re getting on and what the next steps are into the workshop. Oh sorry,
Harris?

Harris:

So, there’s a second workshop as well?

AN:

It’s optional – we’ll let you know about it, and if you can make it that would
be great. You might want to hear what’s come out of all of the focus groups
and the next steps – but we’ll be in touch in the next week or so with your
voucher in relation to this one.

Harris:

[Inaudible 55:36], sure.

AN:

Sarah, final slide? So just again, thank you. We are still recruiting
participants so if you are able to share the details of our project with your
networks we’d appreciate that. And please get in touch with us – and
probably best through Sarah, who you obviously all have her email details.
But thank you so much. Does anyone want to come in with any final
thoughts or comments before we let you all go to stand and stretch and get
your favourite chocolate biscuit? Well, thank you again. All the best, take
care.
