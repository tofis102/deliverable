comfortably?: Developing intervention strategies to support employees aged 18-40 to reduce their 
sedentary behaviour when working at home.  

Description of data
Background
Data associated with a qualitative study to develop health-enhancing solutions to reduce sedentary 
behaviour when working at home. The research for which this data relates involved a series of focus 
groups with two participant populations. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with 
employees and line managers with experience of working at home or leading a team of staff working 
at home. During this study, the research comprised six focus groups – three with employees (18-40 
year olds) working at home in desk-based jobs and three with line managers of the employee 
population. Focus groups were conducted online using MS Teams, lasted approx. one hour and were 
analysed using the COM-B model for understanding capability, opportunity, and motivation to 
change behaviour.

Files 
The files contained in this dataset comprise six focus group transcripts. The files can be categorised 
into two groups: Group 1 – employees, and: Group 2 – line mangers. Each transcripts provides 
verbatim documentation of discussions during the focus groups including questions positioned by 
the researchers and responses from the participants. Responses comprise direct responses to 
questions, as well as comments and suggestions from the participants. Transcripts have been fully 
anonymised. All participant names have been replaced by a pseudonym. Where geographical 
locations, organisation names, job titles demonstrated potential to identify a participant these were 
replaced with generic codes.
