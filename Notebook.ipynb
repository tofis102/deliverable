        "\n",
        "The moderator is split into two sub-personas, the **invisible\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  In both real-life and virtual focus groups, a human moderator\n",
        "    typically decides who should speak next. Only when it is natural for\n",
        "    the moderator to intervene do they speak themselves, for instance,\n",
        "    by clarifying a question, inviting a participant to contribute, or\n",
        "    redirecting the discussion. In practice, the *decision to speak* and\n",
        "    the *formulation of a message* rarely occur simultaneously. The AI\n",
        "    moderator design mirrors this separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Dividing the moderator into two prompts reduces the overall prompt\n",
        "    length, which helps mitigate issues related to token memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  LLMs with weaker reasoning abilities often struggle to consistently\n",
        "    separate their roles, returning a participant’s utterance versus\n",
        "    speaking as the moderator. Combining both roles in a single prompt\n",
        "    would therefore require carefully engineered instructions. By\n",
        "    contrast, splitting the moderator into two sub-personas provides a\n",
        "    more robust and reliable solution, albeit with a slight increase in\n",
        "    latency. However, since API token rate limits constrain how often\n",

Because for me, [inaudible 12:19] on campus, standing and teaching everyone and moving about to then obviously having to teach online. But I wasn’t sure how much of a difference that would\",43,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"have made to office workers as such who would be sitting in an office, compared to sitting at home. So that was quite interesting to see that change for me. But it wasn’t new information but it was displayed well, I thought. AN: Okay. Thanks, Grace. Anyone else want to come in at this point?

I was already aware of, kind of, all this research\",21,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"going on and things like that from my background and I'm very much aware that working from home probably has increased a lot of people’s sedentary behaviour and things like that.

Emily: Yeah, I'm not familiar with the research already but the findings aren't surprising at all and it's really clear how it comes across. AN: Great. And, Emily,\",38,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"are you familiar with the, sort of, growing evidence about the issue of sedentary behaviour on health? Emily: Yeah.

So I'm an advocate for walking specifically. So…yeah. I'm familiar with the benefits\",1,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"of moving and moving more. 1 AN: Brilliant. Thank you, Emily. Was any of the information about the health consequences of sedentary behaviour and prolonged sitting new to anybody? Freya: So I think it's quite useful to, sort of, see it in a graph as well.

That’s such a good point, it’s not just about the impact on your health of sitting for longer, but it’s the change in your lifestyle that that then\",21,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"because cyclical. So having not left the house for a commute, you then might not get up as early and then having to get up early when you return to work’s going to be harder. And also you’ve deconditioned your body.

It’s not just that you’re not doing the activity, it’s the…reinitiating that activity then is\",23,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"far harder as well. AN: Thank you.

Amelia: Yeah, I’d agree with that. Like, it was mostly not new to me. I think…I had a good understanding that sedentary behaviour’s not good.

I think it’s in the news and things and people have a general idea, it’s not the best thing to be sitting down all\",89,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"the time, but sometimes you don’t really fully understand what that would mean until you see, like, a bit more specific information like you shared there.

And I think what we…we’re, sort of, realising from the group that we…many of you have an interest or are involved in research or involved in practice that…around sedentary behaviour and physical activity. 2 And…but will be…are…have already…you’ve said that you're aware of others who don’t have that, sort of,\",89,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"knowledge around this issue. Does anyone want to bring in any other point about…on that question before we move to the next one? Okay. Thank you. Sarah, can I hand over to you for the next question? SM: Yeah. Sure. Thanks [inaudible 17:27]. So thinking now about your own context and I guess we’re maybe trying to reflect back here to, you know, two years ago whenever you were working in the office and now you’re maybe working from home\",83,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"or maybe you're in a bit more of a hybrid situation now but I suppose we’d just like to know or understand if you’re sitting more or if you’re sitting less over the course of the working day than you were when you were in the office.

Hi, [inaudible 18:15]. Olivia: Hi. So I was just going to say, I actually started my job within COVID, so I got my induction and everything through this. But if I was properly, you know, in the office environment, I’d be going to more meetings, more faceto-face meetings. And I’d be going out and about more as well in the community. Obviously\",39,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"because of COVID, I have been sitting and all my meetings are on Teams, so sometimes it’s back to back meetings, so I definitely sit more than I would have been, you know, within the office environment. We have gone back to hybrid working but it’s still not as much movement as it would have been previously. Apart from the commute to get there and walking in to the office, after that you’re just sat down for the whole day\",43,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"in front of a laptop. So it’s not even that you’re going to speak to somebody else in the office because we’re trying to keep a distance and…so it’s very different. SM: So almost the new office environment is very similar to the home office environment actually because you’re…even though you’re doing this hybrid working, you're not actually back to a normal office environment. You’re doing largely what you might be doing at home. Whereas you’re, kind of…you know, tucked\",87,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"in your office, and we’re not really allowed to do all the social stuff and have a chat at the water cooler or with a cuppa or wherever you normally have your chat. And we’re not walking to meetings. Even though you’re in the office, you might still be having an online meeting. Olivia: Yeah. We’ve had Team meetings sitting in the same open plan office sometimes, just to, kind of, keep separate and share screens and show each other\",36,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"what we’re doing so…yeah, it’s different. SM: Okay. So just…not digressing too much but I guess maybe whatever has developed for the home would be appropriate in the new office environment if we continue to have some restrictions even. So I guess we’re maybe not just looking at the home, we’re looking at home environment and the hybrid 3 working environment that this, kind of, intervention or solution would be useful for. Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Hi, Emily. Emily:\",87,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"Hi. I think that my working day if you compared it like for like is probably about the same on balance as it was on the office. I sit for longer periods at home but I’ll take a longer break because I’ll go and put a wash on and things like that. Whereas in the office I’d be getting up more frequently to walk across the room to a printer, for example. But the printer’s closer to me at home.\",0,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"And where I'm finding it’s affecting me is that my working day isn't like for like anymore. I'm far more likely to start work earlier before I’ve even got dressed in the morning. I'm far more likely to sit and do a bit more in the evening. And the sitting isn't the same because I'm not sitting a desk that’s the correct size with the ergonomic chair and lots of flat space. And I'm constantly having to move the cat\",0,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"or the dog out the way and the children out the way. So it’s not good sitting at home, as well as the fact that it’s a different pattern, if that makes sense. SM: Yeah, absolutely. And I guess sometimes at home it’s a little bit more comfortable maybe. I don’t know, sometimes I find myself on the sofa and that’s, you know, quite a nice place to sit. So the urge to move is much less than if I\",86,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"was at my desk at work and sitting upright in the chair thinking about my posture and all that sort of stuff. So I guess there’s that influence at home. Like, the comfort of being at home too, potentially. Emily: Yeah. And I also have ME so it’s good for me to rest horizontally. And I wouldn't do that in the office. So that is very much a benefit for me, is that I can work horizontally. However that has\",88,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"impacts on my body in other ways. SM: Of course, yeah. Absolutely. And that’s really interesting actually because, you know, there’s benefits to that for you but it…I suppose it’s about balance, finding the balance. Right, thanks, Emily, that’s great. And I think, Grace, you’ve got your… Grace…sorry… Grace: You got it right, thanks. So I, kind of, wanted to follow on on what…I think it’s Olivia, sorry if I’ve crucified your name, but I very much find that I'm\",22,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"sitting a lot more at home, but I really was, kind of…I linked on to what you were saying about the, kind of…the flexi working and now we’re doing both, because I'm clinically vulnerable, I’ve got lung disease, so when I'm in the office I'm very much hiding in a corner and not going to any meetings and everything else. So I don’t think I'm actually currently walking more when I'm on campus teaching and doing my meetings than I\",85,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"am at home. This is…it’s quite interesting, kind of, thinking about it that way ‘cause I was still thinking, oh I'm back in the office, I'm being better, but actually I think if I tracked my steps, the only difference would be that walking in and back, not actually when I'm on campus ‘cause I'm just…I'm hiding away from everyone. 4 SM: And I think we’re hearing a lot, you know, even though people are sitting more at home, actually\",85,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"there’s a lot of benefits from it too and it’s really helpful for people to be able to be at home. So I think it’s about getting that balance right, I guess, for everybody. Okay, so we’ve got three hands up. I can't remember who came up first but I'm going to go with Noah ‘cause I think you had your hand up first. Noah: No, thanks. I’d probably say that I'm not really sure whether I'm sitting more at\",51,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"home or in the office. I think…like, I'm quite an active guy myself so in my own time I'm really active and I think at home I do usually get up and go through the kitchen and things like that all the time.

But then obviously all the meetings I have are obviously online and things like that.\",37,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"So although…if it’s a bigger team meeting and I’ve the camera off and stuff like that, I probably will stand up and, kind of, do other things. But walking in the office and stuff like that…so I’d probably sitting is probably less but actual walking or moving about would be more in the office. SM: Okay. And that’s really interesting ‘cause that’s something different again. You know, it’s really doing something whenever your break up you’re sitting too, so I\",43,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"suppose…yeah, okay. Great. That’s brilliant. Thank you. And then I think, Isla, you were next. Isla: Yeah. I would say I probably sit…well I would…I do sit more at home and I think it was Olivia saying, you know, your meetings are just back to back, so you just sit there and just click, like…so I was working obviously and then just click to do this, do you know, and you don’t really think, oh I need to go and\",84,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"move now even though we probably should. But then just listening to everybody, when I'm in the office, I would have probably before this said, yeah, I do walk more, but just listening to what you’re saying, I obviously…I live outside [location removed] so it can take, like, 45 minutes, so I'm sitting on that commute in the car. So I'm still sitting. So probably actually when you’re in the office, mine is just going, I don’t know, to…the kitchen\",5,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"or the bathroom’s further away than it is in my house, so really I'm probably similar in both. So what you were saying, we do need to think about both scenarios now because…yeah, we can’t...I…we’re based, like, on a hospital site, and we would go to the main site of the university. But that’s all stopped. So, you know, it was nice when you walked across and you met people but I don’t know if we will do that. And\",40,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"tutorials and things are online. I know they’re probably changing at the end of this month but…yeah, it’s probably at the minute the same. And I guess with guidelines, until they change or if it’s safe to do so, we won't go to…just call in and chat with someone or have meetings. So, yeah, it’s really interesting what you’re saying, we need to maybe think about both. I didn't think about that up until today. 5 SM: Yeah. I…well I,\",41,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"kind of, had but not really put it in context until we started having this discussion actually and now, you know, the cogs are turning thinking about how that can be a reality. Okay. So I…we’ve got lots of hands up and I think, Freya, you were next. Freya: So…because it's winter actually I sit more. I would have a 40 mile commute in to my main office base, so if I was to factor that in, my dog would\",91,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"have less time being walked and whatnot, but because it’s winter, he absolutely refuses to go outside at the minute. So I find…’cause I'm quite busy with work, I can focus more and forget time effectively and end up sitting much longer. If I'm in the office I have constant distractions, volunteers come in to talk to me or crew come in, if we’re really lucky, the helicopter takes off and that’s always quite cool…always. So in winter I definitely\",5,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"do sit more but in summer I can be more active. My team already agreed we want to do, like, walking meetings. And because I cover the whole of [location removed], I'm never going to be in the same room as everybody I need to see anyway. But it’s…yeah, the typical January blues, no one wants to go outside at the minute. SM: Yeah. Very interesting actually. We’ve heard that in other health research that we’ve done, you know, things…do\",2,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"we need seasonal interventions potentially, seasonal solutions, one for one time…or, you know, people are just happy to go out in the summer months when it’s nice and warm, and in the winter, that’s when actually we need to be, sort of, pushing some sort of solution. Okay. So just in the essence of time, we’ve got Amelia and then Olivia and then we’ll move on to the next question, if that’s okay. Amelia: Yeah, it’s interesting just from what\",90,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"Freya said about the weather. I was thinking…I never thought I’d say I miss the commute…like, I live in [location removed] at the moment, I used to spend an hour commuting, but I miss the walk to the bus, the walk to the…you know, the tube as well. I found that sitting…I definitely sit more during the day. It’s not far for me to walk, like, I'm in a fairly small one bed flat and the kitchen’s, like, right behind\",91,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"me. But if I was out at work already, I’d then almost have more energy to go to the gym. Whereas five o'clock now, it’s dark. I'm not leaving the flat when it’s cold to go to the gym. So I think it…it has an impact, not only for me during the day but how I’ll spend my evening as well. SM: Okay. And that’s really important to bear in mind, you know, we’re sitting a lot in the evening\",110,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"too actually. Although we’re talking about the workplace, our working environment, today, we need to bear that in mind that the evening actually, that…we’re accumulating time in the evening too. So…and…thank you, Amelia. And then Olivia and we’ll move on to the next question. Olivia: I was just going to say about structuring movement more at home. I find that very, very difficult. So when I'm at work, usually I will, you know, take out half an hour for lunch\",109,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"and then I’ll go for a walk or I’ll go to buy my lunch. 6 So that means that you’re getting a bit of a walk, fresh air. But in the house, I just keep continuing with the task that I'm on. And I just get so engrossed in it that, like, I'm eating my lunch, very quickly throwing something together and eating it while I'm working. So I'm sitting again. So I'm quite conscious that it's very difficult to,\",18,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"kind of, structure any kind of movement. Yeah, I might walk to the kitchen or the bathroom during the day but actually exercise or, you know, having a walk is not something that I fit in to my day. Whereas at work I would. However what we did start doing which was good at work was walking meetings. So that was quite beneficial doing that, getting out in the fresh air, meeting your colleagues. And, you know, having a walk\",6,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"at the same time, so that was really good. SM: No, that’s great. Thank you. And here, here, you know, I’ve yet to define my lunch hour and we’re two years in to this working from home. So it just, kind of, happens when it happens. So, yeah, it makes it difficult to plan, you know, ‘cause…and the weather too I guess, as well. So I will hand back over to Ailsa who's going to go through our next question\",111,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"with you. AN: Thanks, Sarah. And thanks everyone. And the next question is around what sort of things influence the amount of time that you spend sitting. And we…you’ve already shared with us lots of really rich information, we’ve talked…you’ve talked about the weather and the seasons and how that can affect it, the environment in which you’re in with…in terms of the size of your house, whether you’ve got laundry to do, all these factors are influential. Is there\",76,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"anything that, sort of, comes to mind as being a key influence on the amount of time that you spend sitting? And even if it’s something that’s come up already, then we’d love to hear again about that. We’ve got Emily and then Grace. Emily: I think for me although my employers are very flexible and very supportive and they’re all working parents working from home and everybody gets it, I have anxieties about feeling as if I'm not available.\",108,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"So if I was in the office and I was at the kettle, people would wait for me to sit back down.

And having to\",81,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"justify when I'm not as well and say, I'm going for a walk now, I won't be available.

I think we’ve almost got in a way of working that we immediately respond to…when things come in and…yeah. So I'm just going to… Emily, you said you’d…nobody’s ever said to you, there’s never been a, sort of, sense that you have to be\",80,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"accountable to that, it’s just something that’s, sort of, evolved through working practices. Emily: Yeah. And I know that others feel the same and then there are those who don’t at all. As I say, my employer’s very, very supportive and my manager doesn’t work that way. She’s not immediately responsive. But I think that…it feels more formal now when someone asks a quick question because they’ve had to send it electronically. Where before it would just be a chat\",112,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"in the office and you’d immediately get your answer and move on. Now people are waiting for that answer. They can't see if I'm available just as easily. I might show available on Teams but be in the middle of another task. So it has changed things. And it’s meant we’ve had to structure time with each other. And also with meetings, the meetings are back to back now where they wouldn’t be before because you would have to factor\",81,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"in time to move from room A to room B, or for people to arrive. And we don’t. So I think we do also try and cram more in. AN: Great. I'm going to move on but I suspect we’ll come back to some of these points when we’re thinking about, well how…what could we do differently. Grace? Grace: Yeah. So I was just going to say that I'm finding since we’ve not got the online or even hybrid...but I'm\",22,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"having much more…many more meetings, kind of everything just seems to be more scheduled in.

Whereas you’re just, kind of, sitting here and going, oh I’ll just work a wee bit longer or I can just do an extra half hour here and there and before you know it you're, kind of, sitting for even longer than what you thought you were going to. AN: Thanks, Noah. And that point you're saying about getting absorbed in work,\",57,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"I think Isla mentioned a similar thing, that you, kind of, just want to get it done and you’re absorbed in it so don’t want to step away. So… Isla? Isla: Yeah. Mine isn't actually really related to work, I don’t know, maybe this is the wrong answer but when I was thinking what influences me, I…through COVID…through the pandemic was doing online exercise classes at night. So I would always bear that in mind and, you know, if there\",39,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"was one night I wasn’t, then I would make an effort to get up, go for a walk and that kind of thing at lunch. But then the days when I wasn’t, I was…you know, when I was doing a class, I would then be like, oh well I can sit longer all day today, I’ll, you know, have lunch at my desk and it's okay ‘cause I'm exercising later, that kind of thing. So I found depending on what\",107,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"I was doing in the evening would then influence my day. But when I was in the office, I would have still done the same kind of thing. But I would never really have thought about it in the office. I don’t know if I just am more conscious now that I'm sitting all day. Once I leave my son with the childminder, I just come and sit and that’s it. But…yeah, it would be more what I'm doing in\",106,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"the evening would influence…and, yeah, make me think I need to get up and do something during the day. AN: So almost like what you’re going to do in the evening could compensate from…for what you have or haven't done during the day when working. Isla: Yeah, exactly. I don’t know, I also went to a seminar…well online…during COVID, of O’Fechlan [inaudible 37:13]’s work all about the compensation with…so then that maybe actually was a bad thing for me to\",110,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"listen to because then I calculated, almost like, oh I'm okay. Whereas, like, if I 9 didn't…hadn’t done that then maybe I would have, you know, spent less time sitting and that kind of thing. But…yeah, so it’s compensating for both but…yeah. AN: Great. Thanks, Isla. I see Emily wants to come back in here. Emily: The other thing that affects me is having the children at home with me while I'm working, where they wouldn’t normally be with me.\",108,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"So the parts of the day where they’re not with me, I feel like I really need to get everything done so that I can be more present with them when they come home. So there's guilt if they come home and I'm writing a report or sitting doing something that my head’s really in. If I'm just answering a quick email I'm far more likely to engage with them. So I feel guilty if I get up during the\",13,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"day. But if I’d been at work, I would get up to wash the dishes that I’d used at work. I would clear my desk. I would empty the bins. But I feel like I’ve doing that at home, those are chores that can wait ‘til after home time. So I'm definitely prioritising my non-sedentary time for times when the kids are there. But of course it’s a fallacy because the kids come home and then I'm sat on the\",23,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"couch listening about their day. And because I sat all day, I don’t feel like moving. I think somebody else had said that too. AN: So…interesting. So those people who are around you are having an impact on you sitting, so for you, your children. Emily: Yeah. It’s just about demands on time. So I'm trying to give the best of myself to them so I am not having an optimal day, to try and just be as productive as\",3,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"I can to compensate for the times when I know I’ll be less productive at work.

I’ll let you…I’ll leave you, Sarah… SM: Oh yeah, sure, that’s absolutely what I was thinking. I think just…we’ve got…we want to show you some of our ideas or\",80,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"some that we’ve found that have been effective in the office environment, so we’d like to get your take on that. So if we can group these last two questions, then I think that’s ideal. And we’ll have time to fit everything in. So really the crux of both of these is, you know, is there anything that would encourage you to spend less time sitting across the course of your working day? Or, do you have any ideas that\",0,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"might be useful for supporting people who are working at home to break up the time that they spend sitting? So I think just, you know, ideas or suggestions, potential solutions and you might have already tried these or it might just be something that you’ve heard about or that you’ve thought of actually over the course of our discussion today. And, Emily, you were there first so I’ll let you come in now. 10 Emily: I love the idea\",63,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"of walking meetings, but I also enjoy video meetings. And I think video calls have become such a big thing. But I think Noah had said that when he’s not got his video on, he’s more likely to move around, even just having calls where the video doesn’t need to be on and having the chair saying, you can turn the videos off for this one, guys, you can move around if you want to, would maybe encourage more people\",82,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"to do. Or if we scheduled conference calls rather than video calls, I could so that while I'm walking. That could be my outdoor time for the da. Whereas if it’s a video call, there’s an expectation I’ll be at the desk. Having a manager lead that way would probably make a big difference. SM: I guess it’s…there’s a cultural thing too though, if you can't see the person then you don’t…are they listening to me, are they, you know,\",82,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"having a gourmet meal while I'm trying to talk about something really important. You know, are they playing with the puppy, it’s…or, are the kids there. It’s all these sorts of things that, you know, you don’t know. And I guess we need to maybe get over that, to be able to…but the Wi-Fi doesn’t work sometimes, it’s better to turn the video off. So we’ve got all those, kind of, issues that mean you can't have it, so it\",56,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"is a really good suggestion I think. And we have a colleague who quite often goes on her bike while she’s in the meeting and she’s moving around, sort of…she always announces it beforehand so that we know that’s what she’s doing. But, yes, absolutely, that’s great. Thanks, Emily. I think…Millie, I can't see you on the screen ‘cause I'm not sure if your video’s on, but I'm pretty sure your hand’s up, so…if you want to come in. Millie:\",82,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Something I’ve noticed because I’ve changed jobs from being in the lab and constantly on my feet to suddenly sitting down so much. And so relatable, what everybody’s saying. So I’ve…I think I’ve…I'm making a kitchen space with a higher, sort of, table so I can stand up most of the time now…or I will be once it’s finished. And also bought on of those, like, big exercise balls so I can just, like, sit and…maybe not\",0,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"exercise but, like, wiggle my bum around just because I did feel the back pain strangely. And it was so surprising changing jobs from active. It’s, like, your muscles are sore but in a different way. Like, after exercising your muscles are sore but this time they’re, like, moaning that you’re not working.

Well just give the marathon a go. You can always not finish it. You know, at least you’ve tried it, that’s my theory anyway. But that sounds great, so good luck for that. And\",55,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"well done, yeah. So Olivia, if you want to come in… 11 Olivia: I was just going to say what Emily was saying about accountability. I feel that even in the video calls, if you aren't…got your camera switched on and people can't see you, that you’re in, you know, the right frame of mind, you’re not just sitting there in your pyjamas or whatever. I think there is a sense of, you know, wanting to be present in the\",103,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"meeting. So that’s why you, kind of, want to attend and if you’re outside walking, then that will be seen as…that this is what you do during your working day, that you go off for, you know, your own leisurely walks and things like that. I was also going to say in terms of ideas, what I think is quite good is, kind of, encouraging a walk for the organisational culture. So within [organisation name removed], and I think a\",26,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"lot of the health boards do this, we did, like, a step challenge. All staff could get involved. So it was doing…taking part in teams to do ten thousand steps each day. And that was really, really good because it made you…even if it was dark, raining outside, you knew that you had to get the steps in. And it actually made you move because I remember sitting for seven hours really a day and not moving and feeling so\",19,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"still and sore. But then actually getting up and doing something. So I think, kind of, doing something structured around getting people to move is really good. And also just being aware yourself. So now every 20 minutes, I do, sort of, think, oh I’ve been sitting for 20 minutes on the laptop, I'm going to just go and do something. I'm going to either make a cup of tea or I'm just going to walk downstairs, whatever it is.\",53,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"So being conscious of that more. I think that’s quite good. SM: And the permission, if that comes from your organisation…you’ve got permission to do that almost so it, kind of, overcomes that cultural social barrier where you feel like, oh I'm not allowed to do this, but if your organisation has set you that challenge and, kind of, validated it and approved it, then you’ve got the go ahead I guess from them. So it makes it a bit\",26,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"easier potentially. Okay. Great. And…sorry, I think Millie has just left. I think I’ve missed her…was saying bye but…anyway, that’s great. Okay. So I’ve lost tracks of hands again. I'm not very good at keeping an eye on things. I think, Freya, if you want to come in, that would be great. Freya: We’re actually quite lucky as a charity ‘cause we do the ten thousand steps challenge and, like, miles for the month. So everyone from our CEO is\",22,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"really competitive. I'm quite lucky ‘cause obviously paramedics, they’re really active in their roles. If we were in the office, there’s actually loads of running paths. So everyone’s quite active naturally. And I’ve noticed quite a difference if we’re on Teams calls with just my colleagues. Anything goes in a Teams call. If you want to be outside, that’s fine, if you want to be in the dark, if you want to wear a housecoat, that’s also fine. So we’re\",104,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"quite lucky in that respect. But we have a culture of your video must be on all the time, which is quite scary sometimes. I myself at home, I started using Alexa to give me 12 reminders to go do something.

SM: Wonderful, thanks, Grace. And then Amelia. Amelia: Yeah. Just quickly for me. I think it is about a culture shift. Like, for example on a Friday I’ll go to a gym class during lunch and it takes maybe slightly over an hour to get there and get back but a Friday I feel like it’s acceptable. But I feel…kind of relating to\",90,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"what some people said earlier, I feel a bit anxious trying to do that in the middle of the week. Even if it's an hour 15 I take for lunch, I just think, oh people will think I'm taking the mick and things.

We’ve got flexible working but I think there needs\",7,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"to be a bit of a culture shift so people feel less pressure to attend.

So it sounds like from above…messages from above would be really useful and supportive for all staff probably. Thank you. And then, Isla, we’ll just bring you in and then I’ll move on to the next slide. Isla: Yeah. No, it was just…I was thinking about what everybody was saying about the camera.

So then I guess I don’t have that level of trust so then I guess maybe if we want that trust, then maybe we need to give it to students. But I was just, kind of,\",114,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"thinking, my…I, kind of, do question it when other people or…you know, particularly the students don’t have it on. So…yeah, maybe we all need to change that view or…I know we are becoming more comfortable with it but…yeah, I guess, I want it one way but then I won't tell…let it the other way, I guess. But…and then I was just thinking…I remember, like, at the very start when we were allowed, kind of…remember when you were allowed, like, out\",114,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"once a day to exercise, I really structured that in and I would work then, like, 8:00 to 4:00 and then go out for a walk with my husband and my son.

But actually it needs\",99,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"to be quite individualised ‘cause what you’re saying maybe going to the gym or doing a bit of housework, well actually doing a bit of housework is still moving, you know. You’re still doing something. And if that’s what you want to do with that, sort of, permission 14 to move time, then why shouldn’t you be able to do that without feeling guilty actually. Okay. So…yeah, that’s great, permission to move. So I think we need to move on\",99,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"to the next slide just to keep ourselves…we’re…we’ve only got five minutes left and…but, please, I know we’re due to finish at 3:00 and if you need to go, you know, that’s absolutely fine, don’t feel that you can't. Okay. So over the past, sort of…since August time, we have been working on this research. And what we did, before we wanted to have the focus groups was have a look at which types of interventions or solutions have been\",100,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"effective in the office environment. So that would prime us for, you know, coming to these focus groups and have an idea of things that already work. And so we identified about ten thousand studies and we sifted it down to 24. And then within that there were different types of solutions that we were able to grip. So we’ll just show three of them today. There’s more than this but this is three just to keep the discussion focussed.\",101,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"And so we’ve heard about education, about sedentary behaviour and the various health consequences that come with it. We have seen regular prompts have been effective in the office and that might be through your computer or a smartphone app or something else, maybe an email. And then also things like personal or individual feedback on sedentary behaviour. And that could be through coaching or information that, you know, you feed in that…about your activity and then a health professional\",27,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"feeds back on that. So we just want to know if you think these would work in the home environment and maybe, sort of, how they might work. Or if they would even work at all. Grace, Emily… Grace. Go Grace, and then, Emily, you can go in, if that’s alright. I’ll do alphabetical order. Grace: Sorry, Emily, it keeps being me. I as just going to say, with the regular prompts, so I have a Garmin watch which tells\",30,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"me to move every hour anyway and as part of my PhD that I'm doing at the moment, I’ve got…one of my groups are following these prompts. People don’t follow them at all. I can tell you that it’s been really bad uptake on it, and that’s despite these people have agreed to be part of the PhD study and agreed to do these prompts and do it. So I would…don’t think the regular prompts will work long term. I\",17,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"think it worked for my group for the first week, but we’re in a six month study and it’s already just, kind of, fallen off the wayside. So I think regular prompts doesn’t really work, in my experience. SM: Okay. Great. That’s really good to know. And that’s backed up with some data, so that’s good. Thank you. And, Emily, over to you. Emily: I would echo that. My experience of prompts in the office was that when we all\",17,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"committed to it together, we did it. We needed that social interaction. So somebody would say, oh that’s me, it’s time to get up. And she’d stand 15 up, so we’d all stand up. And we’d have a 30 second chat while we walked on the spot or something like that. The thing that’s always worked best for me is just making a lifestyle change. So when I'm in the office, I made a commitment to use the downstairs toilet\",40,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"rather than the one on the floor we were on. And my employers accepted that my toilet breaks lasted longer than they did before because I had to walk to the toilet and back. And I got loads more steps in. But it was all about everybody keeping me accountable for that. If they noticed that I’d just been to the one down the corridor, they’d say, oh are you not doing that anymore. And it’d give me a bit\",40,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"of a kick up the bum to get going again. At home, it’s too easy to just hit snooze on that alarm and then before you know it, it’s been another 20 minutes or another hour. So I totally agree that prompts don’t work unless you’ve got something holding you to it, holding you accountable. SM: Okay. Great. That’s brilliant. Thank you. And Amelia.

But obviously when you think wider to offices, a lot don’t. So don’t really realise. So maybe…yeah, there needs to\",48,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"be education. And then the feedback…I think feedback does work. And what I was talking about earlier, like the work by O’Fechlan [inaudible 58:52], so letting people know that, yeah, you do, for example, do exercise but is that enough. You know, ‘cause I do think people have this perception that if they exercise it doesn’t matter that I sat all day. But it’s making sure that it was the right intensity and length et cetera. So, yeah, maybe individual\",48,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"feedback, looking at whether it’s about sitting or whether it’s about compensating or what it is. So I think there’ something in feedback and education. And definitely there’s something in incentives. I know that’s not in…that…think there is. And then that might actually work with prompts because then if you get a prompt and you’re like, oh well, doesn’t matter, but actually if there’s an incentive to get up, then that might work. I don’t know. SM: So a package\",48,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"approach rather than just one thing. It needs to be more than one thing for it to work. What was it that you had said there?

About dose, I think\",47,\"FG_employee_1_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"needs to be individualised too which is, kind of, what you were saying.

And the first question I’ll kick off with, and then I’ll hand over to Sarah, but the first question was really, what did you think about the information in the infographic about sitting and the health consequences\",42,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"– was it new to you, was it something that you already know about it? I’m just going to post in the chat a copy of the infographic if you don’t have it to hand. Who’d like to kick off? Oliver? Oliver: No-one likes going first, do they? You’ll be pleased to know, given that I studied at your place, that none of it was new to me. I think what it helped to clarify in my mind were the\",44,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"very specific consequences and how diverse those are and, I suppose, as well, the point about moving throughout the day. As a person who used to play quite a bit of sport most of my activity was usually condensed to quite short and intense bursts of activity and I think as I’ve got older and less capable of playing sport, or my capabilities to play sport have been realised to not be that good, then I’ve actually spread that activity\",2,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"out over the day. And I think that probably fits closely with what’s been highlighted in the infographic. AN: Thanks Oliver. Ella, I’m seeing your comment and I’ll try and address that as well, thank you. Anyone else? Ava? Ava: So, it wasn’t really a surprise to me. I work in public health, so part of my role is to try and encourage people to be active to reduce their risk of breast cancer. I kind of worked around physical\",94,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"activity for a number of years. But I think what sort of interests me is that, while my role is to promote physical activity, it’s been quite challenging to try and encourage other staff in my work place to be active during the day. And I actually find it very, very difficult to do it as well, because you just find that you do sit a lot more when you’re at home, yeah. And in answer to your next question,\",2,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"yes, I am definitely sitting more at home than I was when I was in the office, for a number of reasons but I won’t go into that just now but yeah, that’s my take on it. AN: Okay, thank you Ava. Anyone else? Harris: Yes, me. So yes, I would say that... I would say that I’m sitting much more frequently whilst I’m at home compared to in the office. Looking at the infographic it’s something that I’m not\",84,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"particularly surprised about. With the exception of cancer, I was very surprised about that, it’s not something that I would have associated with sitting down for extended periods of time. AN: Okay, thank you. So, the specific consequences…I think Oliver as well said, it kind of highlights the different consequences and cancer was maybe one you weren’t familiar with. What about the others, were you aware of these consequences of sedentary behaviour? James? 1 James: Yeah, to be honest, similar\",1,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"to the other comments. With our organisation [organisation name removed] we do promote physical activity through active travel, so a lot of the, kind of, information with regards to the benefits of being active we’re kind of aware of as well. So, it’s really, kind of, because the sectors we work in it’s quite common knowledge. AN: Okay, great, thank you. Well, unless anyone else has anything they want to share in relation to that question it sounds like it’d\",26,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"probably be good to move on and understand a bit more about your experiences of working at home. And Sarah, do you want to…? Firstly, does anyone else want to come in on that before we move on? Okay, great. Sarah, would you like to come in on the next question? SM: Yeah, thanks Ailsa. And obviously if anybody does have anything they want to add at any point, you know, even if we’ve moved on please feel free to\",83,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"use the chat because we’ll have a wee look at that either afterwards or, you know, we’ll pull it back in during the rest of the focus group. But yes, so thanks Ailsa. Just moving on then to thinking about your own context and trying to reflect on if you’re now while you’re working at home, or maybe if you’re in this hybrid situation, do you feel like you’re sitting more or less than you were when you were working\",78,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"in the office predominantly, most of your week being spent in the office? And then also thinking about the things that might influence that, and it might be some social influences, environmental influences, it might be something, you know, just completely unexpected or different. So, just have a wee think about your own context and if you’re sitting, where it is and what kind of factors are influencing that. Ella: Yeah, just for myself I’m definitely sitting more than I\",76,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"was previously. So previously I would cycle to work so that was about 45 minutes to an hour of cycling every day. At work I was on my feet all day besides break times and, you know, for some meetings with people we’d walk and have meetings. Whereas now I’m obviously not commuting and I’m finding myself sitting for all meetings, because it’s not as appropriate to go on walks, you know, putting your camera on or you can’t leave\",64,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"the house due to sensitive information being shared. And I do find that I’ll do some exercise at my lunch breaks, so kind of things like yoga or gentle walks around, but not really any higher intensity stuff, nothing that really gets my heart rate increasing very much. And, you know, just small walks to, like, the grocery store and stuff but I don't have the time to do more intensive exercises or anything like that. So it has impacted\",38,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"me quite a lot. SM: So, it sounds like there’s multiple factors there that are coming into play. So, you’ve got a lack of time because of your work load, it sounds like it’s not cultural to stand up or maybe have the walking meetings now that you’re 2 working at home. And also just environmental things – you don’t need to cycle to your home office any more. Ella: Definitely, and I don’t have a standing desk in my\",14,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"small flat. I can move around my house quite easily but all of those are in sitting positions, on my bed, on my couch, and my desk or dining table are all needed. So yeah, it is a large amount of factors. SM: Okay, that’s lovely, thanks Ella. And I think, Luca, if you want to come in, I think you had your hand up and then we’ll go over to Sophie. Luca: Yes, I think I’m definitely sitting more\",92,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"at home because I’m waking up, the computer’s right there, I’m straight onto work. I have an hour’s walk with the dog at lunch time then I’m back to work. And it’s just so easy to work over your allotted time because you’re right there, you know, there’s not that distinct cut-off point where you’re having your commute to go back home. So, I think I’m definitely sitting more because I’m at the computer more, probably being more productive than\",97,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"being in the office, you know, the procrastination kind of kicks in and you go and make that coffee and, oh I’ll have another one, half an hour later. So, I think I’m sitting more definitely at home than I would be in the office space. AN: Thanks Luca. And Sophie? Sophie: I would say I’m quite similar as well, that I’m sitting a lot more being at home but I’m kind of getting out and exercising more in my\",92,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"lunch break. And we’ve got a kind of company challenge at the moment to, like, win prizes and basically test a new app that we’re hopefully going to launch and that’s, like, encouraged me to get out. Especially it being winter I think it’s a lot easier to just kind of stay inside and just not go out in general, especially if you are working from home and you don’t really have the need to go anywhere. So I think,\",45,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"by having something that’s forcing me to get out there and exercise and that, kind of, like, team aspect as well is really good. And it’s something which has been quite helpful, because before that I’ve kind of just been staying inside for, like, days and days and I never used to be like that before the pandemic and all of that as well. SM: Okay, thanks Sophie. That sounds like quite a collective thing, you know, that there’s limited\",50,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"opportunity to move and you are feeling that you are aware that you’re sitting longer than you would have done in the office. So, I think that’s really good that that’s something that you are aware of. And also, I think this group, just from the few people that have spoken, at lunch break you seem to be doing something quite active on your lunch break, so I think that’s really positive too. And Sophie, I’m really interested to see\",21,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"your app and what comes, that sounds really interesting, so thanks for telling us about that. So, Oliver, I’ll move on to you and then, Ava, I think you had your hand up just a second after. Oliver: Yeah, I’ve definitely got some similarities to what’s already been said. I think the change in commute to work has influenced that initial walk that I would 3 do to the train station, and then from the destination train station to our\",5,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"place of work. What I’ve found is that I’ve filled in that time now by working out at home before I turn the computer on. I probably do a shorter amount of time but a higher intensity of activity in that period than I used to. Throughout the day I think I feel a bit more tethered to the desk than I did when I was at work; usually I’d have to move round the campus in order to teach\",15,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"in different places and that would at least break up the day and I would have some movement, even if relatively short. Because I’m working at home the school drop-offs have become opportunities to do activity. So, whilst it’s about a mile to go to the school, and typically in the mornings we’ll take the car to do that journey, in the afternoons if I haven’t got too much on then we’ll walk up and take the scooters so the\",64,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"kids can scoot back – and that’s sort of been worked into the day. And early on in the pandemic before we had a chance to really sort out the technology that enabled some of the home working that we’re now doing, I’d initially set up my laptop on an ironing board so that I could have a standing desk and be a bit more active, I suppose, whilst sedentary. And then yeah, I think because my wife and I\",93,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"have both been working from home she’s been really great at mid-afternoon, sort of, prompting us or just after lunch saying like, shall we go out for a quick walk? And we’ll maybe work half an hour of a walk into the day – so again, picking up with people’s points with this lunchtime-ish period being a really productive one in terms of being able to get out and do some activity as well. The final bit for me would\",109,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"be that because I wasn’t able to meet key collaborators in the office to do my work, often we would agree to meet outdoors and have a walking meeting. So, most of my PhD students, most of my close co-authors are people that live within an hour’s journey of me and so we would either, you know, meet in the middle or people would park at their houses and then we would conduct, you know, an hour’s or an hour\",36,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"and a half’s meeting whilst on the move. Which really actually came directly from…I think it was when [Professor] arrived at [organisation name removed] she suddenly changed, you know, the…or created a change in thinking about how meetings could be conducted. And that’s directly where I, you know, sort of said to my students, we might as well do this on the move and have a go at it. And that’s made a big difference as well to those meetings.\",79,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"SM: Thanks Oliver. I think that’s really interesting what you’re saying about the ironing board, by the way because, you know, we do hear about the standing desks being a great solution for alternate…we know you’re not supposed to stand all day, you need to go between the two. But people who live in small apartments or small spaces or share a flat don’t have those kinds of spaces that they can add something potentially big into, and so it’s\",10,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"great to hear that you’ve come up with something quite alternative. [Professor], also, she came up with using a shelf on your bookshelf, on your bookcase, so that’s quite a fun alternative, I guess. But yeah, thanks Oliver, that’s great. And Ava, I’ll just bring you in now. 4 Ava: I think some of my, sort of, issues around being less active now are similar to everybody else’s, I mean, I lost my commute. I used to cycle from [location\",5,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"removed] into [location removed] a few times a week and then if I wasn’t doing that I would be walking from [location removed] down to [location removed], when I was commuting by train. So that’s been the biggest loss and I think I really miss my cycle. So I am trying and even through the winter I’m trying to do a, sort of, what people are calling a fake commute, but for me it’s just like getting outside before I\",5,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"start work because I don’t feel like I’ve…I feel like I need to have that outside time before I start my day in the office. But just even simple things like I used to work on the third floor of a building that didn’t have a lift, but I live in a single-storey house and the first for, like, a year and a half I hadn’t really walked up a steep set of stairs and when I did I was…I’m\",59,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"pretty active but I felt really out of breath because I was out of the habit of walking up stairs. So, that was something that I hadn’t even thought about missing out on. And the office is just bigger, like, the office is bigger than my house, so if I want to get up from my desk and make a cup of tea or go to the toilet you’re walking further than I would be in my own home, so\",98,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"I think that is… I think the thing that I struggle with is…I think somebody else mentioned this about the end of the day and just not really having that, sort of, end and it’s just quite easy to just keep doing a task even though it’s gone past when you would normally finish. And if you’ve not got a train to catch or somewhere to go it’s just dead easy just to sit there and think, well, I can\",18,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"just finish in 15 minutes and what am I going to do now anyway? I’ll just be making tea or watching telly or something. So, I think having…like, in the summer I was quite good at arranging to meet somebody after work at a certain time, which means that you have to get up and leave the desk. But if you don’t have that, like others have said, it’s just easy to sit. SM: Yeah, thanks Ava. I totally recognise\",57,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"that, like, sometimes the evening comes and you think, it’s dark outside and it’s raining and I’m not going to go for a run or I’m definitely not going to go for a cycle in the dark and, you know, what else is there to do? In Scotland quite often it’s the grocery store or Ikea or something like that, but you can’t do that every day unfortunately or it would be very expensive. Anyway so that’s great, thank you.\",58,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"So, I’m conscious of time and keen to move on to the next question to make sure that we stick to our schedule. So, just a final invite if anyone has any final points on that before I pass back to Ailsa for the next question? Hi Ailsa. AN: I was really intrigued by a couple of things that were said, I mean, Oliver talked about how his wife has sort of encouraged him to go walking. And I think\",44,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"it was Ava, you mentioned your work colleagues and you’re trying to encourage them to be more active. As a group do people feel that the people around you are having an impact on whether you’re sitting more or sitting less? Luca? 5 Luca: I would say definitely, because my fiancée has a totally different type of job to me, she works with horses and she’s out from morning till noon on her feet everyday whereas I am doing all\",0,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"the driving, doing all the home-based sitting down work, the cooking that kind of thing. So, I claim I don’t have enough energy to do any major exercise after all that, but she has kind of given me that kick to say, look, I’ve been on my feet all day and I can still come back and do the cleaning and help around. So, I also have a threeyear-old daughter, so going out with her for a quick half an\",6,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"hour, hour’s run around definitely has made me think throughout lockdown that you’ve got to have that bit of oomph and get outside and do that bit of exercise. AN: Thanks Luca – being motivated at the end of the day is important. And Ava? Ava: I’d probably say that my colleagues don’t have any influence over how active I am. None of us work close enough together to…live close enough together to do anything together. But I also found\",121,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"it was really difficult to try and motivate my own colleagues, and giving them ideas and putting stuff up on our intranet and it just seem to fall on deaf ideas sometimes – so it’s been a bit of a challenge. AN: Okay, thanks Ava. Anyone else want to come in before we go to the final question? Oliver? Oliver: My work’s tried a few different initiatives. Because I work in a sport department some students wanted to put on\",119,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"yoga sessions for staff. There was some group exercise, things like an equivalent of a Joe Wick’s kind of session that some of the students wanted to run, and initially staff joined in with as well. I think that because it was always a scheduled and formal thing it was challenging, depending upon each person’s individual schedules, and then also because there were great pressures with child care and, I suppose, what’s revealed and not revealed about your home working\",118,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"environment. Being on screen was also an issue and I think people started to find, as time wore on, more personal alternatives to joining in with the, kind of, group stuff. Especially, like, late into the lockdown I would try and go out really late at night because it meant that I could get out and I didn’t have to worry about the kids being in school and that kind of thing. You know, it was all kind of sorted\",118,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"and it meant that the streets were pretty quiet and I could get a pretty long walk in knowing that it was going to be, you know, outside of my time.

Does anyone 6 else have any ideas that work for you or you\",63,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"think could work for you, around helping to break up sitting during the working day? Ella? Ella: Okay, yeah, as I mentioned earlier I have taken to doing more yoga more frequently. I was always someone who did yoga prior to starting to work at home, however, now I’ve taken it on board to do it every day, so doing, like, 30-day challenges and things like that has helped me remain more consistent. I’ve also tried to seek out some\",75,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"other friends, and others that live close by, who maybe have more flexible schedules. And I have a friend who we go for walk once a week and that helps break up the day a little bit because we want to get out in the day time rather than in the dark evenings.

Anyone else got any other thoughts about what helps you break up your sitting during the working day? Oliver? Oliver: Yeah, I think a couple of things for me. One is something I never used to do – I now schedule email time, so I\",74,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"don’t look at my emails first thing in the morning and I have, like, an hour window where I’ll look at those usually around lunchtime. And I felt like, as soon as I put my emails on I was kind of then fitting into the sort of cycle of replying and reciprocal back and forward, whereas to leave them off meant that I didn’t open my emails first thing in the morning and then feel sucked into this, kind of,\",67,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"continuous presenteeism for the rest of the day just in case the people got back to me and so on. So, kind of allocating some time for that has made a huge difference to it. And then second thing is that my work actually came up with some principles that they wanted to be applied generically. And this was initially a product of the Athena Swan process that we went through, and it was built around helping to do childcare,\",-1,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",1],[\"so that was that you couldn't schedule meetings between nine and ten, or between 2.30 and four o’clock. And then there were some principles around the way in which the timetables for our teaching were figured out, which meant that there was always a break somewhere in the day that would allow you to have a lunch, even though we don’t have a formal lunch break, if you know what I mean. And what I think it’s enabled me, and\",7,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"I’ve spoken to other people who’ve felt the same, to do is that where previously they wouldn't have time necessarily to get up, or they wouldn't want to get up early enough to work out then get the train to work, or commute to work, and then be at work is, because there aren’t any meetings usually till ten o'clock, that time is now seen as a window of opportunity, having dropped the kids off, to fit in a quick\",23,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"workout, or sometimes I’ll do a yoga session. And then again, those middle of the day and end of the day periods are times that are, sort of, ripe with opportunity to do some physical activity. 7 So, I think organisations and colleagues discussing what would be beneficial to them in terms of…and agreeing and recognising the benefits of building time into the day that facilitates not only physical activity but other things that are important in life, and recognising\",120,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"the value of those things giving them time, has been really important. And then also, being conscious of the things that usually suck me in and keep me locked to the seat, if you know what I mean, those have been really valuable in changing some of my habits, yeah, in terms of physical activity.

I can see Luca\",120,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"coming in here. Luca: I agree with what Oliver said there. I’m going to move on to a hybrid working approach from next month and I’ve scheduled in that I’ll work nine till half11 on Monday, Wednesdays, Fridays and then have that break and then come back, work from half-one until finishing time. And on Tuesdays and Thursdays I’m not going to start work until half-12 and work right up until late in the evening.

So, [organisation name removed] own [smartphone app name removed], it kind of like sits side by side almost. And smartphone app name removed] is already a game that people, like councils and different partners and stuff, can sign up for in all different areas round the country. And currently, like, they use cards and fobs and there’s speed boxes which are attached to lamp-posts and people will either, like, walk, they’ll run, they’ll cycle and they’ll\",25,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"get points. And it’s spilt, kind of, like, into schools and communities, individuals, so there’s all different kinds of groups of people that can get involved. And with the new app we’re trying to, like, expand it even further. So we tend to have, like, game phases so, like, this upcoming phase we've got four different games. In Scotland, we’ve got one in [location removed], so that’ll be, kind of, in the local area there. But with this new app\",25,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"we’re hoping to expand it more to, kind of, like, the corporate side as well. So, on the app itself you’ll have, like, the virtual beat boxes that you can swipe and they’ll be, like, half a mile away from each other so you have to get out there. And then you can be put into a team or you can do it individually and then obviously if you’re in a team you’ve got that team aspect – if you\",25,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"want to win you want to be at the top. And there’s also gems that you can collect, which are slightly different but they kind of help boost your score as well. But it’s basically encouraging people who may not have been active to get out and try and either walk, cycle, run and just kind of explore their local community and start living a more kind of active lifestyle, and hopefully continue that after it’s finished. Because the games\",28,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"themselves are usually, like, five to six weeks kind of thing, so we try and just encourage people to actually get out there and then to continue that afterwards. It’s quite complicated but that’s… AN: No, that was very clear, and you could see how if in your work organisation you’re doing it for those six weeks, then that could be a stimulus to encourage movement throughout the working day. Thank you, that’s really interesting, we may well come back\",45,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"to you to find out a bit more again. Sarah, are you happy to move on to the next slide? SM: Yeah, sure. Okay, so thanks for that really useful discussion and just being so open and honest about your experiences over the past wee while of working from home, really appreciate it. So, we started this project back in August, and over the past few months we have been doing some review work of published evidence and studies that\",105,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"looked at interventions or solutions or strategies to break up sitting in the office environment. And so, our review we were very stringent in what we were looking for and it was about these interventions that had been effective in breaking up sitting in office-based populations, so people who spend a lot of time sitting 9 where they're working in the office. And we identified somewhere between 10,000 and 11,000 papers – I try not to break out in a\",77,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"sweat when I think about it – but over the months we were together to whittle it down to 24 papers that met our criteria. And from that we then condensed and grouped all the different types of interventions, intervention components and mechanisms for delivery and we’ve come up with six. And we are presenting three of those to you to day. So, we’ve got work place initiatives, and that might be things like standing and walking meetings, and some\",116,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"of you have already talked about that today. And also the challenges – that might be another work place initiative – and also those kind of processes that Oliver talked about that have been implemented. We also have bee looking at supportive working events, so that might be things like your standing desk. It may be the behaviour of others and how that influences the time that you spend sitting. And of course role models – so if your manager’s\",69,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"doing it or your manager’s encouraging a type of behaviour, are you more likely to engage with it? And then training and support to help you to break up the time that you spend sitting, and that might be things like what to do, how to do it and when to do it. So, we would like to know what you…how do you think these kinds of interventions that have been effective in offices, how could they work in the\",77,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"home environment, or be translated to the home environment, so really just some of your feedback on that would be really useful. Hi Sophie. Sophie: Hi. Back when the pandemic started, I know…I think [organisation name removed] gave employees, like, an extra 20 minutes to go out and go for a walk within their kind of, like, schedule working hours. So, maybe something like that could be an option when you’re working from home still, because you know that other\",26,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",4],[\"people in the business are kind of still going out and hopefully getting that 20 minutes walk or, like, if they did yoga or just had a break from sitting down and stuff. So, maybe if you’re knowing that the whole team’s doing it, it might kind of encourage you to participate as well. SM: Excellent, thank you, thanks Sophie. And Luca? Luca: Yeah, I’ll take a slightly different tack to that. I think…I've just started a new role and\",55,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"I was told that everyone in the office was allowed to take their computer chairs, their desks even if wanted, and their chairs, whereas I had to go and buy a new computer desk from Ikea and find a chair second hand somewhere. And I do think if working from home is going to be a more common thing, for the sake of my back I would definitely invest in a better computer chair, and I would certainly hope that\",88,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"my employer would assist in the funding of that item. I’ve never heard of the idea of standing or walking meetings before, so that was quite enlightening to me, and I would definitely partake in a walking meeting with people who want to do so. Or even a joined meeting where you knew everybody was standing, and you could take that ten minutes at 10 the beginning of the meeting to talk about anything other than work so people are\",117,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"getting that, kind of, social interaction. We have a morning chat where it’s ten minutes and you can just pop in and say good morning to everyone, and then we have a tea break chat at about 11 o’clock which people can just jump into and it’s forbidden to talk about anything related to work. And I think those are the types of thing that have been missed potentially through lockdown – that checking on how your colleagues actually are,\",115,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"and I think that’s an important part of happiness within the work place. SM: So, a bit of peer support there, Luca, as well as having your employer provide you with the mechanisms to, you know, break up your sitting or to sit less, just the people around you need to encourage you to engage with it all as well. That’s great. What about the training and support, is that something that would be useful to have? Because I think\",74,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"potentially people need to know why they're doing these things, and why has a standing desk arrived from my employer, and why am I being encouraged to do walking meetings, or break up my day through a prompt or whatever. It’s like, would the training be useful? Oh sorry, Ava, your hand’s up, I didn’t realise – come on in. Ava: It’s okay, I put it up when you started talking. But I was going to go back to role\",34,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"modelling, and I think that’s really important if you’ve got a culture and, sort of, leaders doing the physical activity then I think it makes it more culturally acceptable. So, we don’t really tend to have walking meetings, I don't know why and it just doesn’t seem to have been something that got started. But somebody mentioned about the 20 minutes extra at lunch time, and as part of our [organisation name removed] group we did ask our chief executive\",117,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"to try and encourage people to take the time in the winter, particularly, to take maybe, like, an extra 20 minutes\\u002fhalf an hour at lunchtime to get the outside daylight time, and if they would kind of take that back and maybe work a bit later into the evening or start a bit earlier. But, just having that come from the chief executive seemed to give people permission to do it, but yeah, without the leadership or role models then\",7,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",5],[\"it becomes quite challenging. SM: Yeah, and I think it’s that accountability to sort of manage your own time and emulate what those above you are doing too, and the kind of strategies that they’re adhering to. So, that’s great. And Sophie has put in the chat that the training would be useful. Any ideas of how that would be best delivered while you’re working at home, because obviously we can’t do inperson training sessions and things have sort of\",34,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"merged to become these MS teams, like, training or maybe just an e-learning resource that you work through yourself or something like that, or just a one pager maybe? Sophie: I think just something really simple that people can kind of glance over quite quickly would be quite good, because you obviously don’t want to take up too much time from people’s day, and if you can get it out quite simply to 11 them that’d be good. If you\",55,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"just did, like, a nice infographic or something like that, that could be quite useful. Or you could maybe do, like, some kind of webinar potentially that people could drop in and if it’s recorded they could kind of view it any time they want to maybe. SM: Perfect, thanks Sophie. So, I see the reminder that there’s five minutes left in the meeting and I think there’s less than that now – so, just to invite any final comments\",95,\"FG_employee_2_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"on these active strategies from offices, before I hand back to Ailsa to close off for today.

Harper, do you want to come in next?

And as Claire said, you’ve talked about some of these aspects, but I thought we could reflect a little bit more on these sitting behaviours specifically and think about are you sitting more or less at home than when you were in the office and of course what influences this. So some of the things that you guys\",3,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",6],[\"have been saying is the commute to work has affected some of the sitting while working from home, the less movement at home in terms of your commute to the kitchen and toilet and things like that, and also the breaking up screen time from social interactions.

I was just going to agree with I think I definitely sit a lot more when I’m at home\",51,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"and a lot of that’s because of the small movements that you do in the office so like walking to get a coffee or going outside for lunch or walking to meetings and stuff, so that’s definitely had an impact.

I think I’m much more likely after work working at home to go and\",123,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"sit on the sofa after work rather than go out for a walk or something, whereas if I was in the office, I’d maybe feel a bit more energised to go and do something else after work so maybe it has that kind of knock-on effect as well.

Ivy: Yes, so I was\",125,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"just going to say that actually I found working from home, there are some positives in terms of I would find it depends on how many times a week it would happen because when I went into work, like some people have said, if I go into work, I usually get more tired when I come back and then the next day it will be a nice thing to work from home because it is like a rest, and in\",60,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"some ways then I suppose you could take that as the next day when you’re working from home, you don’t actually go out and walk or anything because you are sort of resting for the days that you’re 6 going back into work.

DS: Right, very interesting, and in terms of your sitting specifically, do you\",0,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",10],[\"know what is influencing your sitting when you’re at work versus when you’re at home? Ivy: So when I’m in work I send equipment supplies to the sites that are recruiting for the trials so a lot of that’s quite physical work.

DS: Thanks for that, Ivy. Evie, are you\",123,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"happy to jump in? Evie: I thought about this a lot and I think in the end I’m probably sitting the same amount of time whether I’m working from the office or working from home or at least was, so when I was working from home all the time, so I’m back to a bit more hybrid working since the last two weeks, and if I was just at home, I’ve found that I needed to just go on a\",122,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",2],[\"walk during my lunchbreak and I needed to work out somehow after work because I just have this pentup energy from sitting.

So, Rosie, great, you go first, I’ll\",63,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"not leave you off this time, thank you. Rosie: No, it’s fine. So what I was going to say is that I think with working from home it’s great because you’ve got that flexibility that has been mentioned, you can try and be healthy, but I think the big thing about working from home is the lack of self-motivation, so something that we can do to motivate ourselves or to be conscious and aware that’s actually a reminder, I need\",60,\"FG_employee_3_pseudo.txt\",3],[\"8 that because literally that’s where I’m failing.

I’d like to hear your reactions to this. Was this information already on your radar, or does any of it strike you as surprising?

Knowing it’s tied to bigger health risks really reinforces why those small breaks I try to build in matter.

At the office, I naturally get those resets when I’m walking across the site to sort something out, but at home I’ve noticed making myself get up and fetch paperwork from another room gives me a very similar lift. It’s such a small thing, yet it\",142,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",2],[\"makes the rest of the afternoon feel lighter and more focused.

Even just walking to the kitchen to refill my water seems to cut through that heaviness and helps me re‑engage with whatever task I’ve been stuck on.

Ethan: That idea of making breaks part of the workflow rather than separate from it really resonates with me. I’ve noticed when I tie movement to finishing a specific task, it feels purposeful instead of like I’m just stopping work. It transforms the pause into a kind of mental milestone, which makes it easier to stick with. Moderator: I’m struck by how several of you\",33,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",4],[\"have mentioned needing to “engineer” little triggers or cues to break up sitting, because the natural ones from office life are no longer there. I’m curious — when you do manage to build in those breaks, what makes it easier for you to actually follow through with them, and when does it feel hardest to stick to? Could you share a recent situation where one of those prompts worked well, or maybe when it didn’t? Harper: What helps me follow\",73,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",3],[\"through is when the break is tied to something practical rather than vague — for example, I’ll make a point of taking calls while standing at the kitchen counter, and because the task itself requires me to be there, I don’t end up skipping it.

Lucy: I really relate to that point about practical prompts working better. For me, setting a clear rule like standing every time I check emails actually sticks, because it’s tethered to something I’d be doing anyway. The toughest moments are when I’m immersed in analysis and don’t want to break concentration — that’s when reminders pop\",4,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",6],[\"up but I almost always dismiss them. It’s a fine balance between honouring the flow of work and still making sure my body isn’t neglected. Noah: I’ve noticed the same thing — if a cue is linked to an existing task, I’m much more likely to do it. For example, I now brew tea in a cafetière rather than a mug so I have to walk back to the kitchen when it needs topping up.

Mia: I’ve found those practical nudges work best for me too. For instance, keeping my reference books in another room means I have to get up between patients’ calls if I need to check something. The hardest time to move is mid‑clinic when I’m racing through back-to-back admin; even\",138,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",2],[\"if a timer goes off, I tend to ignore it because I feel I can’t spare the break, though I know that’s exactly when it would help most.

I hear that practical, task‑linked nudges seem to make moving easier, but the biggest challenge is often that urge to just keep\",31,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",4],[\"going rather than pause. With that in mind, let’s turn toward exploring ideas and solutions. Even if you don’t already do them, what kinds of approaches can you imagine might work well to break up sitting time at home? Perhaps small changes, tools, or routines that could fit naturally into your day. What comes to mind? Harper: One thing I’ve been toying with is treating movement like another “tool” for work rather than an add‑on. For instance, when I need\",31,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",4],[\"to think through a facilities issue, I’ll pace with a notebook instead of staying at the desk, which keeps me active while still moving the task forward. I could see structured prompts tied to common activities—like setting up morning emails to be done standing at the kitchen counter—working because they add no extra time pressure, just a small shift in habit. Lucy: Linking movement directly to the work itself makes a lot of sense to me. I’ve found it helps\",144,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",2],[\"when I deliberately choose tasks that can flex between sitting and standing — like sketching out ideas on paper or reviewing notes while on my feet.

It doesn’t feel like a pause so much as a change of scene, which makes it easier to stick with. Those subtle shifts seem more sustainable than forcing set “exercise breaks” into an already tight schedule. Oliver: What you’ve all said about weaving movement into the task rather than bolting it on really resonates with my own experience. When I’m marking essays, for example, I sometimes pace the room as I think through feedback, and it\",33,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",4],[\"feels far more natural than stopping to do stretches at set times. It makes me wonder if the key is reframing movement as part of intellectual work itself — shifting posture and space as a way of shifting perspective. Ethan: That point about linking movement with thinking really resonates with how I work on code. When I’m stuck on a bug, I often find getting up and pacing around helps me see the solution much quicker than staring at the\",143,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",2],[\"screen. It feels less like a distraction and more like using movement as another way to process problems. Amelia: That idea of using movement as part of problem‑solving really resonates with me too. I’ve noticed that when I get up to pace while mapping out a tricky bit of writing, it somehow loosens my thought process in a way sitting never does.

What feels more natural is tying the movement to a task itself — like standing to skim a guideline, because it fits the flow rather than competing with it.

What’s worked better is almost tricking myself by attaching movement to tasks that don’t require a screen, like sketching out ideas on paper or reading specs from printouts while standing. It feels integrated rather than imposed, so I don’t resist it in the same way. Amelia: I’ve\",147,\"testaccount_gpt-5-chat-latest_NO_HUMAN_2025_08_19_12_28_10.txt\",2],[\"had a similar experience — the apps and buzz reminders start off well but quickly become easy to ignore when I’m wrapped up in work.

Amelia: In my case, the simple act of moving my kettle to the kitchen downstairs has worked wonders — every hot drink break now doubles as a quick stair climb.

In my small home set‑up, I’ve deliberately put the printer on a different floor, so those few trips up and down the stairs happen without me thinking about it. It feels far more reliable than any reminder app, because the space itself prompts the movement.
