Moderator: Hello everyone, and welcome. My name is Anne, I am a researcher focusing on work and health, and I regularly conduct focus groups like this one. Today we’ll be talking about reducing sedentary behavior while working from home. This topic is especially relevant since many of us have changed our daily routines during and after the COVID lockdowns, and I am particularly interested in understanding the challenges you face and exploring opportunities to break up long periods of sitting in a home office setting.  

Before we get into the discussion, I’d like to share a few ground rules. There are no right or wrong answers here — all of your perspectives are valuable. What you share will be treated confidentially, and anything published from this discussion will not identify you personally. Please keep what’s said here within the group, and above all, let’s be respectful of each other’s opinions.  

The conversation will flow in four parts. We’ll begin by talking about knowledge and awareness of sitting behavior, then move into your own experiences of sitting while working from home and what influences that. After that, we’ll explore ideas and solutions to promote more movement throughout the day, and finally, we’ll wrap up with a short summary and feedback. We’ll spend some time on each part, roughly moving from awareness to experience to solutions.  

To get us started, I’d love if each of you could briefly introduce yourself by sharing your name, age, occupation, and a short comment about how you feel this topic relates to you. Who would like to begin?
Amelia: I’m Amelia, 30, working as a Public Involvement Coordinator in health research. Since moving to remote work during the lockdowns, I noticed how quickly whole days could pass with barely any movement apart from trips to the kettle. That’s why this feels very connected to me — I’ve had to make conscious adjustments, like setting reminders to stand or taking calls while walking, just to stop myself from being glued to the chair.
Noah: I’m Noah, 26, a research fellow in public health, and I’ve definitely become more conscious of how static my working days can be since moving home full‑time. During lockdown I was amazed at how easily I could sit from morning until evening without even realising, so this topic feels very relevant. It’s made me think a lot about how much of our routine movement we unconsciously lost when commuting disappeared.
Mia: I’m Mia, 38, a GP based in the UK. Since I started working some days from a small space at home, I’ve really felt how easy it is to become glued to the chair with back-to-back phone consultations and admin. In clinic there’s constant movement between rooms, but here it can feel very static. This topic hits close to home because even as a doctor who advises patients on lifestyle, I find it surprisingly tricky to practise what I preach in this new setup.
Oliver: As someone who lectures from home now more than I ever thought I would, I’ve found the lack of incidental movement quite jarring. On campus I’d be walking between lecture theatres or bumping into colleagues, but at home it’s just me and a screen for hours. It’s made me notice how reliant I was on that built‑in movement to keep me active without ever having planned for it.
Harper: I work as a Facilities Officer, 37, based in the UK, and this subject really resonates with me too. At the office my day naturally includes walking the site or checking on different spaces, but at home it’s just a desk in the spare room and hours can pass before I realise I haven’t moved. Since lockdown, I’ve had to build in mini‑breaks — even little things like deliberately putting the printer in another room or standing for short emails — otherwise I can feel myself getting stiff and sluggish very quickly.
Lucy: Working from home really highlighted for me how much subtle movement was built into office life without us thinking about it. Things like walking to a different building for a meeting or even just heading over to someone’s desk added up, and now those steps are gone unless I plan them in. I notice how easy it is to spend an entire day almost rooted to one spot, which makes this conversation feel really important.
Ethan: When you mentioned those little office movements adding up, that really struck a chord with me. Back in the office, I'd often stroll over to a colleague’s desk instead of sending a message, and now it feels strange how that natural activity just vanished. Working alone at home, I sometimes catch myself sitting so long that even shifting in my chair feels like a big event.
Moderator: Thank you all for sharing a bit about yourselves and how this topic connects to your daily lives — I hear a strong common thread that many of you have noticed just how much natural movement disappeared when office routines and commutes were taken away. That sense of suddenly being “glued to the chair” seems to have resonated across your experiences.  

To build on that, let’s move into the next part of our discussion, which is about awareness and knowledge around the risks of sitting for too long. Research shows that high levels of sitting are linked to increased risks of conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers, as well as impacts on mental wellbeing — things like anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties, and lower emotional wellbeing. Working from home has changed sitting behavior for more than half of office workers, and in some studies close to nine out of ten say they sit more than before. The good news is that these risks can be reduced by breaking up sitting with movement throughout the day.  

I’d like to hear your reactions to this. Was this information already on your radar, or does any of it strike you as surprising?
Amelia: What struck me most was the link with mental wellbeing — I’d always thought about sitting in terms of aching muscles or posture, but not so much the knock‑on effects on mood and sleep. It makes sense though, because when I’ve had long, static days at home I definitely notice I feel more sluggish and irritable. Knowing it’s tied to bigger health risks really reinforces why those small breaks I try to build in matter.
Noah: I had a similar reaction — I tended to frame the risks more around cardiovascular health, so hearing how strongly prolonged sitting ties into mood and sleep definitely made me pause. It makes me wonder whether part of that “foggy” feeling after a long desk day is less about tiredness and more about the lack of movement disrupting that whole mind‑body balance. It certainly gives the small breaks more weight than just stretching sore muscles.
Mia: What stood out for me is how easy it is to underestimate the impact on mental health. When I’m in clinic, I rarely sit still for more than a few minutes, and I don’t get that same heavy, drained feeling at the end of the day. At home though, after hours of back‑to‑back calls in one spot, that sluggishness hits hard. Linking sitting not just to physical strain but to mood really makes me rethink how important those movement breaks are.
Oliver: That resonates with me too — the days where I barely move seem to blur together, and it’s not just my shoulders protesting but my concentration that suffers. Before, I’d have thought of sitting mainly as a musculoskeletal issue, but hearing the link to sleep and mood makes sense of that restless, wired‑yet‑tired feeling after a long online teaching day. It reminds me that movement is less a “break” from work and more something that sustains my ability to work well in the first place.
Harper: That point about movement sustaining rather than disrupting work really rings true for me. On office days, walking the site actually clears my head and helps me problem‑solve, whereas sitting solidly at home leaves me drained and distracted. Realising the mental side effects of staying static has made me take those “get up and stretch” moments more seriously, rather than seeing them as time away from work.
Lucy: That really rings a bell for me too — I’ve noticed that on days when I hardly move, my focus just nosedives and everything feels heavier than it should. It’s interesting how those little bits of activity we once took for granted weren’t just about stretching our legs but seemed to keep our minds sharper and more resilient. It makes me think of movement less as a side task and more as part of being able to function well at work.
Ethan: That description of sharper focus really resonates with me, because I’ve noticed how even tiny bursts of movement, like grabbing water or standing during a meeting, immediately refresh my mind. It’s almost like hitting a reset button — the fog clears and suddenly I can get through tasks much quicker. Hearing the strong link between sitting and mental health makes me feel those little “resets” aren’t just about comfort, but actually essential for staying productive.
Moderator: I’m hearing a lot of you describe that link between long stretches of sitting and a kind of mental fog or drained feeling, which is really interesting. Could you share a time when you noticed your mood, focus, or energy shift during the day because of how much (or how little) you were moving? I’d like to hear what those moments felt like in practice.
Amelia: One moment that stands out was during a long grant‑writing day when I barely moved from my desk until late afternoon. By three o’clock my head felt heavy and every sentence took twice as long to write. I finally went out for a ten‑minute walk, and it was astonishing how quickly my brain seemed to “wake up” again — suddenly ideas came more easily and I felt less irritable. It really showed me how directly my energy and focus are tied to whether I’ve built in any movement.
Noah: I can relate to that completely — for me it tends to happen late morning if I’ve just ploughed through emails without moving. There’s this creeping sense that my eyes and brain are both slowing down, almost like wading through treacle. Even a short stretch away from the screen, like stepping onto the balcony for fresh air, seems to flip a switch and I come back with a clearer head and a bit more pace.
Mia: That rings true for me as well. On days filled with back‑to‑back phone consultations, I can feel my concentration dip mid‑afternoon — almost like my brain has dulled around the edges. If I force myself to stand up and walk a loop around the house between calls, the difference in focus is immediate, almost like I’ve pressed a reset button. It’s small, but it stops me from dragging through the rest of the day.
Oliver: What you’ve described really mirrors my teaching days on Zoom — somewhere after lunch, it feels like my attention just evaporates and every slide starts to blur into the next. The contrast when I actually get up to stretch or pace for five minutes is striking; my voice feels stronger, and I come back to the session more animated. It’s funny how a tiny bit of movement can make such an outsized difference in presence and clarity.
Harper: That’s exactly how I feel during home working days — after a stretch of staring at the screen, it’s as if my thinking just grinds down. At the office, I naturally get those resets when I’m walking across the site to sort something out, but at home I’ve noticed making myself get up and fetch paperwork from another room gives me a very similar lift. It’s such a small thing, yet it makes the rest of the afternoon feel lighter and more focused.
Lucy: That’s so familiar — I get that same “grinding down” feeling when I’ve been motionless too long, almost like the day is pressing in. Even just walking to the kitchen to refill my water seems to cut through that heaviness and helps me re‑engage with whatever task I’ve been stuck on. It really makes me appreciate how those tiny, usually unnoticed movements can transform the tone of the whole afternoon.
Moderator: It sounds like many of you have noticed how your focus, energy, and even mood shift depending on how much movement you build into your day, which really underlines how tied our wellbeing is to these patterns. Let’s build on that now by looking more closely at your own sitting habits when working from home.  

How do you feel your sitting time compares to when you were in the office? Do you find yourself sitting more, less, or maybe just differently — and what kinds of things influence that for you?
Ethan: For me the difference is quite stark — at the office there was this natural rhythm of standing, walking to a meeting room, or just heading to the coffee machine. At home, I can easily sit through three or four hours without moving if I’m caught up in coding or debugging. What tends to influence it most is how my day is structured: if I have back‑to‑back calls, I’m almost locked into my chair, but if I deliberately set reminders or take calls standing, that naturally reduces my sitting time.
Mia: That really resonates — once I’m in the middle of a clinical admin session or lined up with patient calls, I notice hours can slip by without me shifting much at all. In the surgery I’d be up and down constantly, moving room to room, so the contrast is sharp. The set‑up at home makes it far easier to stay rooted, and it often depends on whether my diary is relentlessly packed or if I manage to break up the day with quick pauses to stretch or move about.
Oliver: What jumps out for me is how much more continuous my sitting has become since working from home. On campus, even a packed timetable still meant bursts of walking between spaces, whereas now my whole working day tends to happen in one chair unless I push myself to break it up. The main influence seems to be whether I build in those cues—without them, I default to staying put far longer than I realise.
Harper: Thinking about it, my sitting has definitely become more uninterrupted at home compared to the office. When I’m on site, I’m up and down constantly, but at the desk at home I can suddenly realise I’ve been in the same spot all morning. What helps me is creating little “excuses” to move, like keeping some files in another room or standing for quick Teams chats, otherwise the day just blurs together in one long sit.
Lucy: I’ve found the same thing — at home the sitting just stretches on without the natural interruptions that used to break it up. In the office even walking to a meeting provided a change of posture, whereas now it’s frighteningly easy to stay in one spot until my body starts protesting. I’ve noticed that unless I consciously engineer little triggers to move, the day quickly becomes one unbroken block of sitting.
Noah: What you’ve just said about sitting stretching on without interruption really resonates — I’ve caught myself doing that too, almost like I’ve lost the built‑in breaks that commuting or moving between offices used to give. The strangest part is how invisible it feels until suddenly my body feels stiff or my focus drops. Unless I create those little nudges to get up, the day easily collapses into one long sit.
Amelia: That sense of time collapsing into one long sit really struck a chord with me too. At home, I can suddenly look up and realise I haven’t stood in hours, whereas in the office the movement was almost invisible but constant. What’s made the biggest difference for me is treating breaks as part of my work rather than a pause from it — like scheduling a short walk after finishing a section of writing, which helps stop the day becoming a single block of sitting.
Ethan: That idea of making breaks part of the workflow rather than separate from it really resonates with me. I’ve noticed when I tie movement to finishing a specific task, it feels purposeful instead of like I’m just stopping work. It transforms the pause into a kind of mental milestone, which makes it easier to stick with.
Moderator: I’m struck by how several of you have mentioned needing to “engineer” little triggers or cues to break up sitting, because the natural ones from office life are no longer there. I’m curious — when you do manage to build in those breaks, what makes it easier for you to actually follow through with them, and when does it feel hardest to stick to? Could you share a recent situation where one of those prompts worked well, or maybe when it didn’t?
Harper: What helps me follow through is when the break is tied to something practical rather than vague — for example, I’ll make a point of taking calls while standing at the kitchen counter, and because the task itself requires me to be there, I don’t end up skipping it. The hardest times are when I’m deep in a report or spreadsheet; I’ll ignore the reminder to move because I want to stay in the flow, but ironically that’s when I most need it. One trick that’s worked is deliberately keeping the printer on a different floor — it forces me up whether I feel like it or not.
Lucy: I really relate to that point about practical prompts working better. For me, setting a clear rule like standing every time I check emails actually sticks, because it’s tethered to something I’d be doing anyway. The toughest moments are when I’m immersed in analysis and don’t want to break concentration — that’s when reminders pop up but I almost always dismiss them. It’s a fine balance between honouring the flow of work and still making sure my body isn’t neglected.
Noah: I’ve noticed the same thing — if a cue is linked to an existing task, I’m much more likely to do it. For example, I now brew tea in a cafetière rather than a mug so I have to walk back to the kitchen when it needs topping up. The moments when it fails are exactly like you said, when I’m “in the zone” with writing; I’ll convince myself a break will derail me, but usually the opposite is true once I actually step away.
Mia: I’ve found those practical nudges work best for me too. For instance, keeping my reference books in another room means I have to get up between patients’ calls if I need to check something. The hardest time to move is mid‑clinic when I’m racing through back-to-back admin; even if a timer goes off, I tend to ignore it because I feel I can’t spare the break, though I know that’s exactly when it would help most.
Oliver: What you said about rushing through admin despite knowing a break would help really resonates — I often push myself to finish an email batch or lecture prep before getting up, even as I feel my focus slipping. Oddly, on the times I’ve forced a quick stretch or walked to refill my water mid‑task, I’ve come back sharper and ended up finishing faster. It makes me realise that the hardest part isn’t the moving itself but overcoming that urge to “just carry on.”
Amelia: That point about the hardest part being the urge to “just carry on” really rings true for me. I’ve noticed that when I tell myself I’ll get up after finishing a section, I often end up stretching it out far longer than intended. What seems to work better is making the movement part of the task itself — like jotting notes on paper while standing, so I’m still progressing but not stuck in the chair.
Ethan: That urge to push through “just a bit more” is so familiar — I often think I’ll stand once I’ve solved the bug I’m chasing, but of course that can spiral into hours. What’s helped occasionally is reframing movement as part of problem‑solving, like pacing while thinking through a tricky algorithm. It feels less like I’m dropping the task and more like I’m shifting context to keep momentum going.
Moderator: It sounds like a lot of you have really noticed how working from home tends to stretch sitting into long, uninterrupted blocks — and that the natural cues you once relied on in the office just aren’t there anymore. I hear that practical, task‑linked nudges seem to make moving easier, but the biggest challenge is often that urge to just keep going rather than pause.  

With that in mind, let’s turn toward exploring ideas and solutions. Even if you don’t already do them, what kinds of approaches can you imagine might work well to break up sitting time at home? Perhaps small changes, tools, or routines that could fit naturally into your day. What comes to mind?
Harper: One thing I’ve been toying with is treating movement like another “tool” for work rather than an add‑on. For instance, when I need to think through a facilities issue, I’ll pace with a notebook instead of staying at the desk, which keeps me active while still moving the task forward. I could see structured prompts tied to common activities—like setting up morning emails to be done standing at the kitchen counter—working because they add no extra time pressure, just a small shift in habit.
Lucy: Linking movement directly to the work itself makes a lot of sense to me. I’ve found it helps when I deliberately choose tasks that can flex between sitting and standing — like sketching out ideas on paper or reviewing notes while on my feet. It feels less like I’m interrupting the flow and more like I’m just shifting the setting slightly, which makes it easier to keep the habit going.
Noah: What you’ve both said about blending movement into the work itself really resonates — I’ve started drafting outlines or reviewing notes while standing at the window, and it somehow feels more fluid than treating it as a “break.” I keep wondering if more of our home routines could be designed that way, so the shift in posture feels like a natural extension of the task rather than a disruption.
Mia: That idea of blending movement with the task resonates strongly — I often need to read guidelines or jot down notes between patient calls, and I’ve started doing those bits while standing at the worktop instead of staying at my desk. It doesn’t feel like a pause so much as a change of scene, which makes it easier to stick with. Those subtle shifts seem more sustainable than forcing set “exercise breaks” into an already tight schedule.
Oliver: What you’ve all said about weaving movement into the task rather than bolting it on really resonates with my own experience. When I’m marking essays, for example, I sometimes pace the room as I think through feedback, and it feels far more natural than stopping to do stretches at set times. It makes me wonder if the key is reframing movement as part of intellectual work itself — shifting posture and space as a way of shifting perspective.
Ethan: That point about linking movement with thinking really resonates with how I work on code. When I’m stuck on a bug, I often find getting up and pacing around helps me see the solution much quicker than staring at the screen. It feels less like a distraction and more like using movement as another way to process problems.
Amelia: That idea of using movement as part of problem‑solving really resonates with me too. I’ve noticed that when I get up to pace while mapping out a tricky bit of writing, it somehow loosens my thought process in a way sitting never does. It makes me think we could frame posture shifts almost like choosing the right environment for the type of thinking we need, rather than a separate “health task” we have to force in.
Moderator: I notice many of you have touched on that idea of blending movement *into* the work itself — almost using posture changes as part of problem‑solving rather than as a “pause.” That feels like a really powerful shift. I’m curious: have you ever tried prompts, reminders, or even feedback tools (like step counters or screen nudges) to support this at home — and if so, how well did they fit with your routines compared to these more natural task‑linked habits?
Mia: I’ve tried timers and the odd app that nudges you to stand, but honestly they never stick for me. If I’m mid‑consultation or buried in admin, I just dismiss them and carry on. What feels more natural is tying the movement to a task itself — like standing to skim a guideline, because it fits the flow rather than competing with it. Those prompts work best when they feel woven into the job, not layered on top.
Oliver: I’ve dabbled with reminder apps as well and found they quickly slid into the background once deadlines loomed. What’s worked far better is treating the act of moving as part of the academic process itself — for instance, I’ll stand to annotate a tricky passage or pace while untangling an argument. It feels less like “leaving the desk” and more like shifting gears, which oddly enough makes it easier to sustain both the focus and the habit.
Ethan: I’ve had a very similar experience with reminder apps—after a few days they just become another notification I click away. What’s worked better is almost tricking myself by attaching movement to tasks that don’t require a screen, like sketching out ideas on paper or reading specs from printouts while standing. It feels integrated rather than imposed, so I don’t resist it in the same way.
Amelia: I’ve had a similar experience — the apps and buzz reminders start off well but quickly become easy to ignore when I’m wrapped up in work. What’s lasted for me is more about creating little rituals, like always standing to jot down reflections after a meeting or pacing while I read draft sections aloud. Those habits feel less like discipline and more like part of how I actually get the work done.
Harper: I’ve had the same experience with generic reminders fading into the background after a week or two. What’s made more of a lasting difference for me is when the action I need to do practically forces me up anyway, like having to collect documents from the printer upstairs. It feels less like willpower and more like part of the job, which makes it far easier to repeat without thinking too much about it.
Noah: That’s exactly how it’s felt for me too — the generic reminders just fade into noise once I’m absorbed in writing. What’s stuck are those little built‑in cues, like always topping up my cafetière or standing to reorganise notes, because they’re anchored to tasks I’d do anyway. It’s less about forcing discipline and more about creating friction that naturally nudges me out of the chair.
Lucy: I’ve had the same issue with standard reminders — they quickly become background noise when I’m focused. What’s helped me more is creating little “rules” that link naturally to tasks, like always standing when I’m sorting through data printouts. It feels less intrusive and more like a built‑in rhythm to the way I work, which makes it much easier to keep up without relying on sheer willpower.
Moderator: It sounds like many of you have found that generic reminders fade into the background, whereas subtle, task-linked cues feel much more natural and sustainable. I’m curious — if you think about your own routines at home, what’s one small design change to your space or workflow that could *naturally* build movement in, without relying on willpower or notifications? Could you describe a moment where your environment shaped your behavior in this way?
Ethan: One thing I’ve noticed is that when I keep my whiteboard on the opposite wall from my desk, I automatically get up to sketch out ideas instead of trying to force them onto the screen. That small placement trick changes the rhythm of my coding sessions because it naturally introduces little walking breaks without me planning them. It feels less like effort and more like the space itself is nudging me to move.
Harper: That makes me think about how I’ve set mine up too — I keep my files and reference manuals in a cupboard down the hall instead of within arm’s reach, so whenever I need one it naturally breaks up a stretch of sitting. It doesn’t feel like I’m “forcing” a walk, just doing the job, but it makes a surprising difference in how heavy the day feels. The space almost does the reminding for me.
Lucy: Something similar happens for me when I keep my notebooks and reference papers on a shelf across the room rather than stacked by my desk. It means I automatically get up several times a day without really thinking about it, and those short steps break the monotony. It’s funny how small tweaks in where things are placed can subtly shift the whole rhythm of the day.
Amelia: In my case, the simple act of moving my kettle to the kitchen downstairs has worked wonders — every hot drink break now doubles as a quick stair climb. It doesn’t feel forced at all; it’s just part of the rhythm of the day, but it guarantees me those little resets that I’d otherwise forget. It’s surprising how such a tiny layout tweak can shift how much movement I get.
Noah: That example about moving the kettle downstairs really struck me because it shows how powerful such small design tweaks can be. I’ve noticed when I keep my reference books on a separate shelf rather than piled at my desk, I automatically break up long stretches of sitting without even having to think about it. It makes me realise that shaping the environment might actually be more effective than relying on self‑discipline alone.
Mia: That point about shaping the environment really resonates with me. In my small home set‑up, I’ve deliberately put the printer on a different floor, so those few trips up and down the stairs happen without me thinking about it. It feels far more reliable than any reminder app, because the space itself prompts the movement.
Oliver: It’s interesting how those subtle environmental tweaks end up being more dependable than our best intentions. I’ve noticed that when I place my pile of marking on a side table across the room rather than right by my chair, each essay becomes a small prompt to stand and move. It’s such a minor adjustment, but it turns the work itself into the nudge rather than relying on me to remember.
Moderator: It’s interesting to hear how much of our last discussion circled back to the power of *small, built‑in nudges* — things like where you keep your kettle, books, or printer — and how those adjustments in your space almost do the reminding for you. Many of you noted that environmental design often feels more natural and sustainable than relying on willpower or external reminders.  

Before we close, I’d like to take a step back and hear your reflections overall. Thinking about everything we’ve discussed — from awareness of the risks, to your own sitting habits, to strategies for building in movement — what stands out most to you from this conversation? Is there anything you’ll take away or try differently in your own routine after today?
