assistant: Okay. Let’s begin.

Thank you for agreeing to speak with me today. I want to start by simply acknowledging the effort it takes to share your experiences. There’s no right or wrong answer here – just your perspective. 

To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brought you to consider talking about this today? Just what felt important enough to explore at this moment? Please, just tell me whatever comes to mind.
user: Hi
assistant: Okay. Thank you for saying that. It’s perfectly alright if it feels a little… difficult to articulate that at the outset. 

Could you perhaps elaborate slightly on what you mean by “that”? What specifically is it that you’re referring to when you say “that”? Just a little more detail, if you’re comfortable sharing.
user: hi
assistant: Thank you for responding. It’s understandable if it takes a moment. 

Could you describe the feeling associated with saying “hi”? What’s present when you experience that particular utterance?
