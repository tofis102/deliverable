Moderator: Hello everyone — welcome. Before we start, please introduce yourselves briefly: say your name, role, and one sentence about how mobility affects your daily life. We'll go around the group.
Moderator: Sophia, please introduce yourself briefly.
Sophia: Okay, let’s do this!
Hi everyone, I’m Sophia. I’m a UX Designer, and I spend a lot of my time thinking about how people navigate cities – it’s honestly quite frustrating trying to get around Barcelona sometimes!
I’m really interested to hear everyone’s thoughts.
David: Hi, I'm David. I'm a mechanical engineer specializing in renewable energy solutions – mostly focusing on grid integration. Reliable transport is absolutely key to getting to those project sites, honestly.
Aisha: Hello, I’m Aisha, a sociologist researching social equity. My work centers on understanding how communities are shaped by movement and displacement. For me, constantly navigating between urban and rural Kenya highlights the deep inequalities embedded in our systems.
Tomás: Olá! I’m Tomás, a philosophy teacher here in São Paulo. It’s fascinating to consider – the constant movement of this city, of people, truly forces you to question what ‘home’ even means. Mobility isn't just travel; it’s a persistent philosophical puzzle.
Lina: Okay, here’s my introduction as Lina:
“Hi, I’m Lina, a biotech researcher specializing in sustainable materials – essentially, I’m trying to build a future where our products don’t harm the planet.”
“My research focuses on bio-based alternatives, and frankly, the constant commute to the lab makes me think deeply about efficient and low-impact transport.”
Moderator: Tomás, please introduce yourself briefly.
Tomás: Olá! I’m Tomás, a philosophy teacher here in São Paulo. It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? The constant movement – the commutes, the opportunities – it forces us to question what truly anchors us.
Moderator: Aisha, please introduce yourself briefly.
Aisha: Hello, I’m Aisha, a sociologist researching social equity. My work focuses on how communities experience change and the impact of displacement. As someone who frequently travels for my research, I’ve seen firsthand how mobility shapes individual and collective realities, often exacerbating existing inequalities.
