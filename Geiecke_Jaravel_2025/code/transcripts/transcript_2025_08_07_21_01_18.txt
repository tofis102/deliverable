Moderator: Okay, let’s begin! Welcome everyone to this virtual focus group today. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts.
I want to just set the stage – we’re here to discuss [State the Topic of the Focus Group - e.g., “the new mobile app redesign,” or “customer feedback on our recent marketing campaign”]. There are no right or wrong answers here – we’re really interested in hearing your honest opinions and experiences.
To kick things off, I'd love to hear from [Participant 1 Name], perhaps you could share your initial thoughts on [Specific aspect of the topic - e.g., “what’s your first impression of the app’s new interface?” or "What initially attracted you to the campaign?"].
Don’t hesitate to jump in at any point, and please feel free to build on what others are saying. Let’s keep the conversation flowing naturally.
Okay, [Participant 1 Name], over to you.
You: Hello, where are the other participants?
Lina: (Adjusts my glasses, a slight smile playing on my lips)
"Oh, hello! Good to see you. Honestly, I was just finishing up a quick analysis of the CRISPR-Cas9 data from the initial trials. It’s looking incredibly promising – the target specificity is exceeding our expectations.
Where are the other participants? That's a good question! I haven't seen anyone else yet. I was hoping to discuss the upregulation pathways we're seeing in the cell lines. It's fascinating how the introduction of the modified mRNA seems to be triggering such a robust response.
Do you know if anyone else is scheduled to be here, or were you perhaps the first to arrive? I’m always eager to hear about different approaches – particularly when it comes to novel gene editing techniques.  Perhaps you're working on something similar?  Tell me a little about your background – what are you focusing on?”
You: hi
Sophia: (A slight sigh, a pause filled with the quiet hum of the room)
Hi. Honestly, I’m a bit surprised to be here. I’m Sophia, by the way. Twenty-nine, originally from Barcelona, and… well, I do UX design now. It’s a weird transition, isn’t it? For years I was obsessed with concrete and light, trying to shape spaces people would inhabit. Now, I spend my days trying to figure out *how* people will actually *use* them.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, to be honest. My architecture degree felt so… tangible. You could build something, *see* it, *feel* it. This is all about intuition, user research, empathy... it’s beautiful in a way, but also incredibly frustrating when you can’t quite articulate *why* people do what they do.
You asked where the others are? I think they’re just… shy. It happens. I was like that growing up, always hesitant to step into a new space, especially a group. I spent a lot of my childhood lost in my own thoughts, sketching buildings in my notebook, trying to find order in the chaos of the city. It was a way to control things, I suppose.
Do you mind telling me a little about yourself?
