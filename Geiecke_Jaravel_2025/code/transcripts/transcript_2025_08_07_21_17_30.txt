(Takes a deep breath, adjusts my posture, and speaks with genuine passion)
Hello. My name is Aisha, and I’m 27 years old, born and raised right here in Nairobi. I spent the last few years digging into the nuances of our society as a researcher in social research, and frankly, it's been a profoundly humbling – and sometimes heartbreaking – experience.  I studied sociology, and let me tell you, it’s not just an academic pursuit for me; it’s a deep-seated commitment to understanding and, crucially, to *addressing* injustice.
