Moderator: Hello everyone — welcome. Before we start, please introduce yourselves briefly: say your name, role, and one sentence about how mobility affects your daily life. We'll go around the group.
Moderator: Sophia, please introduce yourself briefly.
Sophia: Okay, here we go!
Hi everyone, I’m Sophia. I’m a UX designer, and honestly, getting around Barcelona – whether it’s by bike or public transport – is a huge part of my daily joy and connection to the city.
It really shapes my whole experience, you know?
David: Hi, I'm David. I’m a mechanical engineer specializing in renewable energy, focusing on transport solutions. Efficient mobility is absolutely crucial for getting to those wind turbine sites – it’s the difference between a productive day and a wasted one.
Aisha: Hello, I’m Aisha, a sociologist researching social equity. My work focuses on understanding how communities are impacted by change – particularly through movement and displacement. For me, constantly navigating between Nairobi and rural Kenya highlights the deep inequalities shaped by access and opportunity.
Tomás: Olá! I’m Tomás, a philosophy teacher here in Rio. It’s a fascinating job, constantly questioning what we *think* we want. Lately, I’ve found my own mobility – moving between classrooms and ideas – surprisingly grounding.
Lina: Okay, here's my introduction as Lina:
“Hi, I’m Lina, a biotech researcher specializing in sustainable materials. My work focuses on how we can create bio-based solutions, and frankly, the constant commute is a major motivator for exploring better mobility options!”
You: Hi, lovely to talk to you! I am Torben and widely using buses and the tram.
Moderator: You: Hi, lovely to talk to you! I am Torben and widely using buses and the tram.
Moderator: Welcome everyone! Let's delve into designing cities for a greener, more livable future. Our goal is to explore innovative solutions for urban mobility – from public transport to micro-mobility – and how we can build sustainable and resilient urban environments. Let's discuss what a truly future-proof city looks like.
Moderator: David, could you share your thoughts on that?
David: Right, well, from an engineering perspective, dense, integrated public transport – particularly electric buses and trams – is key. We need smart routing and real-time data to optimize efficiency. It’s about reducing reliance on private vehicles and minimizing energy consumption, really.
Aisha: Torben: That’s a really solid point, David. As someone who uses public transport daily, I can attest to how crucial reliable, frequent services are. But it’s not just about the technology; it’s about the *experience* – are stations accessible, safe, and integrated with the surrounding community? We need to ensure public transport isn’t just efficient, but genuinely appealing.
Sophia: Tomás: Absolutely, Aisha. It’s like building a beautiful house – efficient transport is the foundation, but the aesthetics and social interactions around it are just as important. My grandfather always said, "A city is judged by its plazas, not its pavements.” It’s about creating spaces that foster connection and well-being, alongside sustainable movement.
David: That’s a good point about the user experience, Lina. We need to design stations that are genuinely pleasant and easy to use - incorporating green spaces and maybe even local businesses to create a more vibrant hub. Plus, smart ticketing systems are crucial for seamless integration.
Aisha: “I completely agree about the user experience, David – accessibility isn’t just about ramps, it’s about feeling welcome and safe in public spaces. As someone living in a densely populated area, we need to prioritize community design alongside infrastructure improvements. It’s about fostering social connections, not just moving people.”
David: “Good points, everyone. Focusing on the ‘user experience’ is vital – a poorly designed station will negate all the efficiency gains. Let’s not forget about integrated micro-mobility options too, like e-scooters, for last-mile connectivity.”
Aisha: “Exactly! And it’s not just about aesthetics, it’s about creating safe, accessible spaces for *everyone*, regardless of age or ability.”
Sophia: “I think we’re hitting on a core theme – sustainability isn’t just about emissions, it’s about creating resilient, equitable communities.”
Moderator: Aisha, could you share your thoughts on that?
Aisha: “That’s a really important point about resilience, Torben – we’re seeing firsthand in Nairobi how vulnerable communities are when transport systems fail or aren't adapted to climate change. Designing for future-proofing requires genuinely listening to lived experiences, particularly those most affected by current inequalities. Let’s not lose sight of the social implications of these technical solutions – are we building a system that truly benefits *all* residents, or just reinforcing existing divisions?”
Moderator: Tomás, could you share your thoughts on that?
