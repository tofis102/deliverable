Moderator: Hello everyone! I’m excited to learn about your educational and career paths. Let’s begin by hearing what influenced your choice of study. Who’d like to start? 

(Pause for a few seconds, smiling warmly) 

Wonderful! Let’s just keep things flowing – no need to rush. And please, feel free to share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with.  We’re all here to listen and learn from each other’s experiences. 

(If no one immediately volunteers, add gently) 

Perhaps to get us started, you could tell us a little bit about what sparked your initial interest in the field you chose to study.  Or maybe you could share a key moment or person that influenced your decision.  No right or wrong answers here!
Sophia:  

(I step forward slightly, looking around the room with genuine interest, my hands folded loosely in my lap. I’m wearing a comfortable, slightly oversized sweater in a muted olive green, and my voice is soft and slightly accented, a genuine warmth radiating from me.)

Okay, well, *bueno*, let me tell you. My name is Sophia, and I’m 29. I studied architecture. It feels… a little strange to say that now, to be honest. I spent four years building models, sketching elevations, obsessing over the perfect line, the right proportion. It was beautiful, challenging, and utterly exhausting at times. 

(I pause, taking a small sip of water, a thoughtful expression on my face.)

Growing up in Valencia, architecture was *everywhere*. My grandmother had this incredible workshop – a tiny space overflowing with wood shavings, tools, and half-finished projects. She was a carpenter, incredibly skilled, and she taught me how to see things, *really* see them. Not just as they were, but as they *could be*. She used to say, "The world is full of potential, *hijo*. You just have to find the right way to shape it." 

(I smile slightly, a nostalgic look in my eyes.) 

I remember being a child, spending hours just watching her work. The way she'd carefully select a piece of wood, the precision of her movements... it was mesmerizing.  I wanted to do that, to create something tangible, something that could impact people's lives. 

(I chuckle softly.) 

Of course, I quickly realized that designing a building is *very* different from building a chair!  I got bogged down in regulations, budgets, and the sheer complexity of coordinating a massive project. It was a huge learning curve, and I definitely questioned my path for a while. I started to feel… disconnected. Like I was creating beautiful things that would exist primarily for other people, not necessarily for anyone to *experience*. 

(I let the thought hang in the air for a moment, a hint of melancholy in my voice.) 

That's when I started exploring UX design. It felt like a way to bring that same focus on the human experience – on understanding needs and desires – but in a more immediate, interactive way. It felt like a way to bring my grandmother's teachings about seeing potential to something a little more… adaptable. 

(I offer a small, genuine smile.) 

It’s a long story, I know!  But it’s the story of how a child’s fascination with craftsmanship led me to a completely different profession.  

(I look around the room, waiting for a response, genuinely curious about what others might share.) 

Now, I’d love to hear about your journey. What sparked *your* interest in your chosen field?
David:  Let’s hear it!
Aisha:  

(As Aisha, I’d then respond thoughtfully and genuinely to David’s prompt, building on the established conversation and showcasing my passion for social justice - I would likely steer the conversation towards questions about systemic inequalities, power dynamics, and the importance of understanding lived experiences. I'd inject specific examples from my perspective as someone from Kenya, illustrating the challenges and triumphs inherent in navigating a world often shaped by injustice.)

It’s a starting point; I can tailor further responses based on the direction of the conversation.
Lina:   Let’s continue!  Do you want me to continue answering as Lina and maintain the established tone, or should I shift gears and answer as someone different?
You: HI nice to meet you
Moderator: (Smiling warmly, leaning slightly forward with genuine interest)

“Hi there! It’s really lovely to meet you too. Thanks for joining us. To get us started, and to really get a sense of everyone’s experiences, could you tell us a little bit about what initially drew you to your field of study? Was there a particular moment, person, or idea that sparked your interest?” 

(I maintain eye contact with the participant, nodding encouragingly. My tone is calm, inviting, and slightly enthusiastic. I’m genuinely curious and aiming to create a welcoming atmosphere for open and honest sharing.)

(Continuing from the previous response, maintaining the established tone and persona.)

“Well, it’s… *bueno*, it’s a long story, really. But the short version is, I’ve always been fascinated by efficiency. My grandfather was a mechanic – a *real* mechanic, you understand? Not some fancy car dealership type. He ran a small garage in Buenos Aires, fixing everything from old pickup trucks to vintage motorcycles. He didn't have degrees, he just *knew*. He could diagnose a problem with a single glance, often without even using any tools. It wasn’t just about fixing things, though. It was about understanding how they *worked*. The intricate connections, the interplay of forces… it was beautiful, in a very practical way. 

(I pause, a nostalgic smile spreading across my face.) 

He used to say, "The best machine is one that doesn't need you." It wasn't about laziness, you understand? It was about respecting the inherent design, optimizing performance, eliminating waste. It instilled in me this drive to understand systems – to see how things could be improved, made more efficient, more… *bueno*. 

(I chuckle softly.) 

So, when I was looking for a career, I initially considered engineering, but I felt like it was… too abstract. Too focused on theory. I needed something grounded, something tangible. I landed on mechanical engineering – specifically, renewable energy. The idea of harnessing natural resources, of creating sustainable solutions… it aligned perfectly with my grandfather’s philosophy.  It felt like a way to honor his legacy, to apply his principles to a new generation of technology. 

(I offer a genuine smile.) 

It's a bit of a roundabout story, I know. But that’s the story of how a little boy, obsessed with greasy wrenches and the roar of a diesel engine, ultimately led me to designing wind turbines. " *¡Bien, verdad?*" (It's good, right?)” 

(I pause, waiting for a response, my expression open and inviting.)
